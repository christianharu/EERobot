5,For the last few nights I've heard weird sounds outside my bedroom window.,Oh no! Do you think it's a wild animal?
7,I don't think so_comma_ it doesn't sound like any animal I recognize. It's really creepy.,I hope it's not a crazy person or worse_comma_ an alien waiting to abduct you!
9,I love spending time and helping out my grandma,That's kind of you
11,She is so fun to be around too,I bet she really appreciates you
13,My former roomate left her cat keychain here. We fought a lot_comma_ but I kinda miss her now.,Is she far away from you now?
15,Yea. She's going to grad school across the country now.,Oh_comma_ can you go across there and visit her?
17,I swear traffic is the worst in this city. I was almost in a car accident on the interstate going 80 MPH the other ady with my baby in the car.,Wow you too! It's crazy how many bad drivers there are.
19,I know for real she was literally right beside me_comma_ didnt even look once and just swerved right into my lane - luckily there was no one beside me because i had to swerve to avoid her hitting me it was intense.,Well I'm glad you weren't hurt.
21,I've been processing what being lonely feels like_comma_ because I want to be able to have fun by myself sometimes,I think that's a good idea so you aren't always dependent on others to have fun and just enjoy time to yourself.
23,True_comma_ and I've felt that way before_comma_ but sometimes like a wave of those kinds of feelings hits like I'm not worthy enough and stuff like that_comma_ but it's all good,Meditation on goals and positive ideas during some of that alone time can be so uplifting and refocuses you.
25,Sometimes I'll forget to feed my dog. I can't help but feel bad about it...,That's not good at all

31,yes_comma_ i did keep it. im holding it for a couple more days.,Is someone getting married_comma_ or a baby?
33,lol_comma_ its one of the them,Well tell them I said Congrats on whatever it is. As long as it's not a baby marriage.

51,Before he left_comma_ he damaged a lot of my stuff and property.,That's horrible! If you don't have insurance there are a lot of pro bono lawyers that will take your case. Report it to the police so it is documented and justice will prevail. You don't deserve or need to put up with that.

96,I was very angry when a co worker lied about a car accident to get out of working July 4th. I covered his shift till midnight and he was lying about the accident,That isn't very nice.

105,Have you ever heard a song on the radio and it just takes you back to a different time? Like an escape?,All the time. That is part of listening to music I suppose. The songs remind you of when you first heard them.
107,Yeah_comma_ I guess that's fair. It happens all the time to me too. Sometimes makes me wish I was reliving those moments but I don't think I would really want to go back..,I know what you mean. However_comma_ the older I get the more I want to go back LOL.

122,This last Saturday_comma_ I was waiting in the line for the official to sign my driving license documents at DPS. I don't know how_comma_ but i suddenly fell to the ground as if my legs stopped working. It was so embarrassing as there were many people,These people are not people you see everyday. I wouldnt worry about it
124,You are right_comma_ but still i felt like being humiliated in front of these people. Emotional sting would not let me stand still as if nothing happened,Watch some youtube videos of other peoples misfortunes so you can forget about yours quickly!

1058,I was so terrified last night! I heard a noise outside my bedroom that sounded like someone was tapping on the window!,That must have been very scary! Did you investigate it?
1060,I did! I nervously peeked outside and found out it was just a bird that was jumping on a tree branch_comma_ which made it hit the window! I thought for sure I'd see a person when I looked out!,lol yeah our minds can play tricks on us when we're nervous. I'm glad it was nothing serious though.

1103,Yes_comma_ he's ok now. It was a very anxious time though because for awhile we did not know if it was bacterial or viral.

I can't imagine how rough that must have been.
1105,I didn't get the promotion I work hard for at work.,Me neither_comma_ how do you feel about it?
1107,I was pretty upset_comma_ but I will just try harder next time.,me too_comma_ best of luck!

1133,"I never wanted to be the ""grocery list"" person_comma_ but I did it today and its the first time in years I didn't forget something. I shouldve beem doing this all along especially with three kids.",Oh yeah_comma_ totally. And then you don't end up buying too much or too little_comma_ and you don't waste time trying to remember things. There's also tons of little apps on your phone you can get that can make it really streamlined and convenient.
1135,I have so many apps_comma_ but I get frustated with technology easily. I think the list thing might work out after all,I'm sorry to hear that. Maybe give it one more try_comma_ and if you continue to like it_comma_ that might be your sign to stick with it. Good luck!

1153,Just my pride.,It happens. Have to be careful sometimes.
1155,i was sad when i had to miss my sons game,I bet you were_comma_ but I am sure you had a good reason.

1178,Oh gosh yes. I wore a beautiful dress. I felt so pretty!,That's great_comma_ but you don't have to wear a fancy dress to be beautiful. I'm sure you're gorgeous no matter what you wear!
1180,Thank you! I feel like a slob lately.,It's ok_comma_ just try your best to remind yourself how beautiful you are and practice self-care as a habit.
1182,Today wasnt a good day,Why was it not a good day? What happened?
1184,The doctor recommended hospice for my grandad today,Oh_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that. My father in law had to have hospice and although it's not what you want to hear_comma_ the people that work with hospice are really a lifeline for the family.
1187,I always get nervous when I drive. The possibility of getting into a car accident is nerve wrecking.,I hate driving_comma_ I avoid it as much as possible.
1189,I think it has to do with seeing a lot of car accidents when I was little.,Mine was from being in one and just being nervous about having to be in charge of things.

1201,We did! We were living in Japan at the time_comma_ and we were paying this clinic 2000 yen a week so we could keep getting ultrasounds of the baby.,What is 2000 yen equal to in U.S. currency?
1203,At the time_comma_ the exchange rate was about 110 yen to the dollar_comma_ so it was pretty affordable_comma_ and worth it to keep going back.,It sure sounds like it. I think healthcare in Japan is much more affordable that here in America_comma_ do you agree?
1205,I wouldn't be able to tell you_comma_ since I wasn't under their healthcare system. This was just a women's clinic that offered this service pretty cheaply.,Oh_comma_ okay_comma_ well I watched a documentary about healthcare in other countries. I understand that doesn't apply here.
1207,My friend lost her cat on Monday. We called the shelter_comma_ and they say they might have a cat that matches our description.,That's good news. Is her cat microchipped?

1227,I am impressed by the idea of the Nintendo Switch_comma_ it seems really cool and seamless,I like it too_comma_ what is your favorite game?
1229,I think it is a mix of Zelda_comma_ Fortnite_comma_ and Splatoon,I like those games too!
1231,I've worked as a programmer for the last 7 years and this year's review was finally all positive!,That is awesome to hear _comma_ i bet the pays good too

1436,I could definitely feel it going to other way if I was defeatist in my interview.,Being defeatist is never a good move. Honestly_comma_ once you've got your foot in the door I think it's all about personality.
1438,It can be_comma_ but personality can't make up for incomptence either.,I would argue most good employers can diagnose incompetence from the first or second conversation. If they can't_comma_ maybe they aren't good employers.

1646,I just saw an old tv show on tv and it reminded me of the old days,Heck yeah! I love old tv shows! What was it?
1648,That 70s show. I guess it wasn't that old but it is for me.,Yeah. It's kind of old now. Was a really good show for its time until the RANDY DAYS
1650,I stole from my parents and they caught me. I felt so bad as they yell at me.,I would feel guilty too if I was in your shoes. Did you feel bad because you stole or bad because you got caught?

I think you should report the to the police if you notice any strange or threatening messages_comma_Feel free to also call me if you need anything! :)
1659,I just had a huge test that I was supposed to pass. I bragged to everyone that I would_comma_ but I don't think I did.,Oh no what happened? Why don't you think you did well?
1661,I spent so much time talking about studying and didn't really study that well. I think I'm gonna have to inquire about the grade_comma_ it's eating me up inside!,I hope its better than you expect!
1663,I was scared the other night when I heard several gunshots in a row.,Oh wow_comma_ I hope you are fine!
1665,I am. I am in a very dangerous neighborhood so you just never know if it's going to get you and the police don't show up.,Yikes. If I was you_comma_ I would get my own gun! Better to have it and not need it_comma_ then have not have it then need it!
1668,The other day I stole my neighbors mail.,That wasn't very nice.

1692,Almost a year. We're a little bit older though so I dont feel like its a rush into a relationship sort of thing.,You learn a lot about someone when you move in with them_comma_ so if you feel comfortable in your relationship I think that's actually rather prudent.

1696,I don't know what to do. It's so quiet here and nothing to do.,that sucks

1718,I introduced my oldest daughter to the movie Fight Club the other day.,Interesting choice. Did she like it?
1720,She loved it. She's 17_comma_ I was 18 when it came out and I would watch it all the time with my friends back then.,That's good to have something in common. Make the memories.
1722,I think our job might be laying us off.,O No! Are they going to offer you any kind of package?
1724,Doubtful honestly.. they dont seem to care very much. :/,Im sorry to hear that. Maybe you should contact your HR and see what your options are
1726,So i feel very horrible because i lied to my wife the other day,oh no_comma_ that's bad :( what did you lie about?
1728,She asked me not to give our baby anything sugary before going to sleep and she went to take a shower and my son really wanted the cookie i was eating so i gave it to him. he had hard time falling asleep,that's not good :( so i bet your wife asked you if you give him something and you said no? you should tell her

1742,Super upset with a company I thought was trustworthy.,Why what did they do to betray your trust?
1744,Well I looked up reviews..I didn't see anything bad in my FB groups about them either..and they decided to charge me early and didn't want to refund me!,I would be so mad I dislike when company's charge my card did you call to get a refund for the charge?
1746,They had NO number_comma_ support was super rude but finally refunded me..not without a lot of threats though :/,I would make a complaint and try contacting the BBB that is so unfair or even get your bank to dispute the charge.
1749,I once walked around school campus and found toilet paper on my shoe. It had been hours since I was in the restroom last.,Oh no_comma_ did anyone notice
1751,I hope not! I went to classes and ate food all while having this paper tail.,I am sure no one noticed
1753,I was pretty sure I was going to get a good grade on my paper,"""was"" pretty sure ?"

1761,I accidentally passed gas in front of my mother in law.,Oh no! Did she say anything about it?

1773,every week i have a laundry list of things i need to get when i get paid. then pay day comes and it's gone in a second.,Hm I can relate to that haha
1775,it is really hard to always be broke,I'm not always broke but I feel like what helps is leaving my credit / debit card at home and just carry cash for what I need
1778,My coworker got the job promotion that I had been working so hard to get.,That sucks. I have had that happen. It did not feel good.
1780,It doesn't I felt I worked harder for it_comma_ too.,Sounds like you deserved that promotion.

1790,I left my dog alone in the house when I went to get the mail. While I was gone she got in the cat box and ate the cat poop_comma_ super gross.,I would have hated to clean that up. I wonder why they do that?
1792,There was nothing to clean.... she definitely swallowed it. I stuck her outside cause I can't even think about dealing with her licking anything right now. Gives me the hebbie jibbes thinking about it.,Yea that is so gross but also kind of funny. I cant help but laugh.
1794,I'm really pleased with myself! I've worked really hard lately and I was able to pay cash for all new kitchen appliances!,That something which you should be proud of.

1798,I was so scared when I watched the new Insidious movie. I am such a scaredy cat!,I do not like those movies because of that
1800,Yeah_comma_ I don't know what I was thinking.,I guess try and forget about it
1802,I am having a hard time coping with having to kick someone out.,Are you kicking them out for a valid reason?

1806,In university_comma_ for my major of social work_comma_ we all get mandatory internships where they place us in certain ones and we have no control over it. Some other students received cool internship placements_comma_ and I feel like mine doesn't compare. Kind of disappointed I didn't get something more interesting,That's unfortunate. At least you can use the experience with your current internship to get you to another place you want to go!
1808,Yeah_comma_ that's kind of true. We can't change them while in school. They have to place so many people_comma_ so they can't really give people the flexibility of choosing where they want to go_comma_ or else that would get too complex and hectic. So_comma_ I understand that. But still.. some of these places don't match up to some others. I'll be twiddling my thumbs and not learning much_comma_ while others will get a good experience. I guess I just have to make the most of it.,That's a great attitude. You will be fine_comma_ and can use this as a learning experience
1810,I locked my keys in the car and didnt have a spare one.,That's the worst! What did you do?

1828,I feel so bad for having a drunken one night stand.,Why does that make you feel bad? You're allowed to have fun sometimes.
1830,Because I am married.,Oh that would be tough. Have you told your partner?
1832,I saw something near impossible...some Indian monks taking turns dragging forward a Subaru in neutral by their testicles...looked painful but hey it beats calling AAA I guess,I find this context hard to believe.

1850,Yes I do but I was hoping to save them for something else sadly,uh oh_comma_ so you just gonna drink a bunch of coffee?

1885,Last time I ordered pizza from my local pizza shop for delivery_comma_ they forgot my sauces!! So I called and complained and was ensured that it would not happen again.

When we arrived 10 minutes later_comma_ our table was not ready!",That is so annoying. They should not call it that if they can't guarantee 10 minutes.
1895,That's what I told the hostess. There was no point in calling ahead if we still have to wait 45 minutes for a table.,Hopefully the food was at least worth the wait. I would have been annoyed as well.

1939,My friend is a teacher and took a kid in who was being abused.,She is a saint!

1987,its a shame the way some people act towards the U.S,I agree. I wish all the countries would get along. No need to be mean to each other.
1989,exactly! the world would be such a better place,Also I think all the countries should allow foreigners to visit. I don't understand why they are so territorial.

2943,I am so upset with my children,That's no good. Why are you upset with them?

2989,I know I broke up with my ex_comma_ but I can't help but feel irritated when he talks about going on dates.,That must be weird to talk to your ex still.

2993,I went into the bathroom at work today and someone had clogged it.,Wow that's really frustrating.

3084,He just got put on so its anytime now. They usually wait like 1-2 mths here,I'm sorry to hear your going through so much stress. My grandmother was on the heart Transplant list for about a month before getting a new heart. Maybe it will be that fast for him.

3328,At first I felt that way_comma_ but over a period of time it can get very overwhelming.,i can see where isolation can be overwhelming and the need for social contact is desirable and needed

3379,I knew I was going to do well on my last test. I studied hard,They say for the prepared there is no such things as a surprise test.
3381,That is true,So how did you do on the test?

3407,Not as unfortunate as what I just heard but thanks. I had to run home and take a shower right away. Now I walk around with an umbrella!,That_comma_ I think_comma_ is a pretty justifiable response honestly_comma_ lol. Now at the very least all you'll have to do is clean the umbrella!
3409,I had a roommate in my dorm who didn't clean up his dorm room at the end of the semester and the school fined me and the other two roommates $100. I was furious at that guy.,Did you try to get the money from him? He sounds like a pretty bad person.

I want to get it clean before school starts so I can enjoy it being fresh during the semester,Nothing like a deep clean to breathe new life into your home! Its a great idea to get it out of the way now so it won't me on your mind once things start to get busy.
3473,Yeah_comma_ I'm the type of person to get stressed out and become unable to work in an environment that's too cluttered or dirty. It starts to make me feel claustrophobic. I have a good gene I guess_comma_ because cleaning relaxes me_comma_ while to others it's like a chore.,I completely understand that. Its a good quality to have and is actually healthier in the long run if you keep your surroundings clean.
3475,I got in my car to go to a baseball game. I was really excited to see some of my favorite players. When I got there_comma_ heavy rain started to come down. Eventually they cancelled the game.,That has been happening a lot lately. Everyone in the US seems to be getting wet.

4905,I let my new neighbors borrow our lawnmower. It came back broken.,That's terrible. Do you think they'll take care of it>
4907,No. They went pretty quiet.,Hope you don't end up in court.
4909,I had to have this oral surgery once_comma_ I remember it very well because it was an uncommon procedure. They had to go up in my gums and attached a chain to one of my eye teeth and sew it back up and then once everything healed the orthodontist pulled the tooth down slowly over several months by attaching the chain to my braces.,I hate the dentist_comma_ they poke and prod so much.
4911,Yeah_comma_ it was the orthodontist but my teeth are so straight and pretty now_comma_ it sure was painful and hard to put faith in someone over 5 years of surgeries and appliances in my mouth and all that jazz. I remember asking everytime_comma_ is this really going to be worth it?,I had braces growing up too_comma_ the worst part for me was the molding!
4913,My neighbor_comma_ who I've lived near for eight years_comma_ just got a brand new boat.

4930,I woke up one morning and found a puppy in my bed. I wasn't expecting that!,Whoa! Was that a good surprise_comma_ or a bad surprise? I could see that going either way_comma_ but at least it would be exciting! I had that happen when I got one for Christmas. Well_comma_ actually it was in my parent's bed_comma_ and I barged into their room to ask if we could go downstairs and open presents_comma_ and I saw the one they had gotten me and had been hiding to surprise me with.
4932,That sounds like a fun Christmas morning. For me it was a fine surprise. I think my wife got it for herself_comma_ but surprised me with it.,That's pretty cool! I hope everything goes well with the training and raising of it. Your wife sounds really cool to do that for you.
4934,A friend of mine spent all night partying instead of staying home to study. He ended up failing an important exam!,That is no good. I bet he regrets it!
4936,I sure hope so! I warned him about going out drinking too often. Maybe this will teach him.,I hope so that is frustrating.

4951,I think my boyfriend is seeing someone else,That's terrible. Have you confronted him about it?
4953,ormation,I'm not sure what that means_comma_ but you should talk to him about it!
4956,I get excited around men and not sure if I might be gay,Yes may very well be gay. Nothing wrong with that. Ive had alot of gay friends.

4998,I finally got my dream job_comma_ but was so nervous about starting it. Going into a male dominated world as a young female can be scary.,Good on you for taking that stand! You must be very proud of yourself

5008,16 months,Adorable so happy for you!
5010,I left work early today and feel a little bad about it. I was really sick and now I know I'll have to play catch up later today when I go back.,Oh_comma_ you shouldn't feel bad! Everyone gets sick every once in a while and I would hope that your boss and coworkers were very understanding of your needs. It is important to take care of yourself.
5012,I hope they understand but it's usually frowned upon. I just was so violently ill I couldn't be there any longer.,Well_comma_ it is very important for you to take care of yourself and if your boss doesn't understand that_comma_ I would be searching for other employment. Hopefully_comma_ they are completely fine with your needs.
5014,My children recently started school again and it made me feel a bit apprehensive. They are growing up so quick_comma_ and I know it won't be long before they sadly move out of the house :(,oh man well at least its a good thing to see them grow

5035,A few days ago I've met a couple of people that got me feeling negative things_comma_ even though I don't even know them.,Did they say or do anything specifically to you that made you feel that way?
5037,Not really_comma_ maybe just a bit_comma_ it's how they said it I guess.,I understand how that can make you feel a certain way. Unfortunately_comma_ there are those types of people around every corner.
5039,I love Halloween and it's almost here. I can hardly wait,I have not been a fan the last few years but I am happy for you atleast! :) lol Any special tradition?
5041,Always a party_comma_ decorating the yard_comma_ just a really good time. You will have to come over and I will win you over.,Well I mean when it sounds like that much fun then its a deal and I think you are right.

It was quite annoying but eventually he came to me after I called to him for a bit.,Oh man_comma_ I hate it when my dog starts barking at the neighbor dogs too. I'd be so mad at him for getting out though.
5053,Yes it was quite distressing as I live next to a major street! Luckily he didn't cross it and simply went next door but still!,Oh man_comma_ that sounds super scary. I'm so glad your dog is okay I would be lost if amything happened to mine.
5055,It's supposed to rain very heavily today so I brought my umbrella to work!,I hate working when it rains hard.

5072,My storage unit got robbed while I was moving to a new home. They took all my family antiques and precious items.,That's terrible. I don't know what's up with this world anymore_comma_ it seems like things are always getting worse.
5074,I know_comma_ thought about selling those things. wish I had done that. at least got money for them.,Well if they were family heirloom or photographs_comma_ I don't really think the money would have been important. The family passes down antiques and precious items for keeping.
5077,I had to renew my driving license. After 3 months_comma_ they told me that they lost my paperwork.,Wow. The MVA is just so frustrating to deal with sometimes.
5079,It is frustrating. They made me waste three months for nothing.,I guess you get no apology of course.

5094,I wonder how my ex got such a pretty girlfriend. He doesn't look that great.,Damn_comma_ what would you rate both of them? I know it might be a little childish but it helps me picture it haha.
5096,Well I would rate his girl as a 9 and him as a 6.5. Seriously_comma_ he drives a beat up jalopi and still lives with his mom. I just don't get it.,Wow he really dated up this time around_comma_ lucky him I suppose.
5098,I came home one day and found that my dog had unzipped my bookbag_comma_ gotten a sandwich I had forgotten I brought home from lunch_comma_ and opened the bag it was in without damaging it to eat it.,That sounds peculiar. I've never known a dog with such finesse_comma_ yours may have talent.
5100,He's an evil genius. He tried to get toys out of a christmas stocking one time by climbing on the coffee table.,That's really cool_comma_ it makes me want to consider getting a dog.
5102,I am submitting a proposal for a manuscript to an editor. I am hoping she will publish it!,Oh that's amazing! Is it a novel?

5110,I still use all of my mothers cooking pots. She passed away a few years ago. Its a great reminder of her.,That is so wonderful that you have something of hers. I'm so sorry you lost her. That is so difficult. Did she love cooking?
5112,Yes and she was very good at it. I can still see her cooking my favorite dishes when I use them.,You still have her right there with you! Its wonderful to know that you're keeping her food and memories so alive!
5114,My best friend and I are planning our weddings at the same time but she has a much bigger budget than I do.,Oh man_comma_ must make you feel bad.
5116,Yeah. It's not the worst thing by far and I still can put together a special day but yeah it does irk me a tiny bit.,It's better not to compare your situation to others sometimes.
5118,I am happy its almost the weekend.,Good for you.What is the reason of all this happiness?
5120,I am going to the beach this weekend.,You choose the best time.The summer is perfect for beaches.

5124,I cant even remember. It was so dumb. I hope we get married.,It's normal to fight about things as a couple_comma_ but I would wait a little longer before you decide to get married :)
5127,My boyfriend can sing really well but I can't,Don't be so hard on yourself. Some people are just naturals!
5129,Thanks_comma_ maybe I just need to warm up my vocal chords more,Singing is like any other skill. With time and practice_comma_ I bet you can really tune those pipes!
5131,I really like the new football coach.,I like football_comma_ who are you talking about? what team?

5137,It hasn't been that hard either.,That must mean you really do love and care about her.
5139,I was very anxious to start driving at 16.,I know that feeling. It's nerve racking trying to incorporate everything you learned at the DMV in real time.
5141,It really is. It's like I can't remember all the rules of the road.,It's also scary thinking about getting in a car accident the whole time_comma_ that would definitely get me nervous.
5143,my boyfirend us breakfast for the first time,What did he make you?
5145,The worst omelette I have ever had_comma_ It was terrible,Well_comma_ at least he tried. You have to be happy about that.
5148,My radiator broke down in my car that I rely heavily on.,Oh no! Sorry to hear that. Can you get it fixed?
5150,I can but they said it will cost at least 2000 dollars for it to be replaced. Might have to buy a new used car!,Wow that's expensive! I hope you can find a reasonable used car.
5152,I close on my new house Monday_comma_ I didn't think I was going to be able to purchase it but I believed in my mortgage adviser,I've been through that process before and it was not easy. Good thing you had a good adviser.
5154,Surprisingly it's been a painless process. I'm very thankful.,You have been very lucky. You should keep their business card in case you ever decide to buy another house.
5156,I attended a ball recently_comma_ one of the girls had the most stunning dress.,A ball_comma_ how fancy! Was the girl as stunning as her dress?
5158,No way_comma_ her dress looked like little diamonds had been stitched on every inch of her dress. Not many girls can compete with that. Diamonds are forever.,Yeah_comma_ I can see a dress like that can easily outshine any girl. The dress sounds amazing though.
5160,Several years ago one of my neighbors dogs attacked me and I had to go to the hospital to get stitches.,Yikes that's no good. How many stitches did you have to get?

5164,I start my diet Monday and let's just say I am not ready to start lol.,I am never ready. which diet are you trying
5166,The keto diet and I have started looking up meal preps and workouts but as of non I am so not arranged to start this up I need more time.,I think my favorite and easiest would have to be Atkins but still alot of prep to get started
5168,I have to look into that one never heard of it thanks.,your welcome_comma_ and I will check out Keto.
5170,I was talking with my brother and he lied to me. I'm so gullible though it takes me awhile to realize it.,What did he say?
5172,He told me that he got a big bonus from work. I found out from my mom though that he lost his job instead.,Why would he even do that?
5174,I pirated a few games recently and I'm enjoying the hell out of them. I sort of feel guilty for not supporting the developers though.,Yeah... that's a tough one. I've pirated stuff before. Kind of how it goes as a poor college student. Maybe when you get older you can pay for things appropriately.
5176,Older? I'm thirty! But now I have kids and money is tight sometimes. I might still buy the guys soon.,Hahaha... Good point. I understand. Some things are just more important_comma_ fair point. My fault on assuming your age.

5190,I hope also. I hate to have to wait.,Yes_comma_ that is not fun at all. I've been there and it's hard not to think about anything else. I really wish you the very best
5192,I lied to my girlfriend once about how much education I had because I felt she would leave me otherwise,Did you ever come clean?
5194,Yeah_comma_ I had to. It was too big of a secret. We had a really_comma_ really long talk. But she loves me for me_comma_ so she was able to accept it_comma_ and I've started working towards almost finishing the education I lied about having in the first place.,That's good. I always like about not understanfing football when I meet a guy. It makes them feel good lol
5196,You know actually speaking on that_comma_ I've historically been a terrible cook but I've been practicing a lot and I'm getting really comfortable with where I'm at. I made caramel-fudge brownies today and they were reaaally good.,Man_comma_ that sounds really delicious. Where'd you get the recipe?
5198,My boss from work has all sorts of recipes like that. She taught me how to make Jalapeno Pepper Jelly_comma_ and that's so excellent on biscuits. You should try it if you haven't had it before.,Your boss sounds pretty amazing. I want to work with you guys_comma_ hahaha.

5276,Yes! I am going to the keys on vaca! woo hoooooo cant wait,Think I've talked to you before_comma_ still hope you have a nice vacation.
5279,Im nervous about accepting a job offer I just received. I noticed a couple red flags while I was interviewing.,That's always a weird situation. You're excited about the offer_comma_ and you're worried that if you turn it down that you might not be able to find anything else_comma_ or as good. But you also don't want to be tied down to a bad place. What were some of the red flags_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?
5281,Well it sounds like I will be working really long hours without getting paid overtime. It doesnt seem like the salary offered will be worth the amount of time I will be at the office.,That's a really tough position to put yourself in. You would know better than most. I'm a cautious person.. if I felt like there was even a 54% chance of being able to find something close to decent_comma_ I'd turn them down. But if you think it's a desert out there and you can't find something to come close_comma_ it may be worth gritting your teeth and being there for a few years before you try to move on. I hope it works out!
5283,My dog yakked all over the carpet last night.,Wow_comma_ that is very annoying. What will you do clean the carpet?
5285,I don't know! It's sooooo disgusting. I'm thinking about hiring a maid to clean it up.,That is good idea.
5287,I am getting a motorcycle tomorrow since I just finished my motorcycle endorsement class! I feel really good about hitting the road!,Congrats! That sounds like a lot of fun. Do you already have a bike?
5289,I just bought it and pick it up tomorrow! I finally feel comfortable enough with my skills to drive on the roads!,That's awesome. I hope the weather is good for your first ride.
5291,When I was planning my wedding_comma_ the caterer we were trying to go with kept blowing us off and dodging communication.,Oh no_comma_ did you find a backup caterer
5293,Yeah_comma_ we dropped them with enough time to find someone else_comma_ but it was unnecessary stress we didn't need.,Of course_comma_ the wedding can be the most stressful event of your life
5295,I remember when a candy bar was only 54 cents.,Yeah. The times have changed
5297,Those were the good old days.,That is true. I wonder if things will be like those day
5299,They are calling for bad weather here over the next few days so I went to the store to stock up on the essentials in case the power goes out.,I would be scared of that
5301,How come? As long as you're ready for it_comma_ everything turns out okay.,I am not sure I am ever prepared
5303,I'm really close with my sister_comma_ but it turns out she is moving out of state in September.,Ah_comma_ I'm sorry to hear that_comma_ is it for work or something else?
5305,Yeah her husband has to move_comma_ it just sucks because we hang out pretty often.,That does suck_comma_ well maybe you guys can work something out to see each other every so often.
5307,My friend invited me to visit him in the new country he moved to_comma_ but I've heard such bad things about it that I'm afraid to go_comma_ and I keep putting it off.,I would be careful. There is a lot of unrest in the world right now.
5309,That's what I'm thinking. But how do I say that to him without coming off ignorant and offensive?,I would just have a heart to heart with him. I guess I would be honest. You want to please him but you have to take care of yourself_comma_ too.
5311,I was having a party so I started getting ready for it two weeks in advance. I wanted to be ready.,Makes sense
5313,It never fails if you wait to the last minute something will go wrong.,Yep. That always happens
5315,I am a bit envious of my friends,How come?
5317,They have nicer homes and cars than I do. Plus they are all married. I work just as hard and I have nothing,Everyone blooms on their own time_comma_ you'll get there_comma_ I promise.
5320,I was so excited when I got my new puppy_comma_ it was awesome!,"Man_comma_ I'm so jealous of you. I love that new puppy stage_comma_ as tumultuous as it can be. There's just so much emotion and ""new feelings"" going on as you watch it grow."
5322,I agree with you_comma_ the joy of adding a new member to the family is a wave of emotions_comma_ positive ones of course!,Yeah_comma_ but then there's also those late nights where you have to take them out because they're not used to holding their pee/poop in. And also them peeing and pooping in the house as they learn not to do that to begin with. They just have unlimited energy_comma_ so it's hard to keep up sometimes_comma_ but also fun!
5324,My friend bought a new car. This makes me so jealous!,No_comma_u don't have to be
5326,It makes me feel inferior. Hopefully I will get over it.,Yes_comma_u will surely get over it
5328,It sucked when I was in senior year of high school since my brother left for college.,I could imagine. Were you two very close?
5330,Yeah very_comma_ so that's what made it so lonely.,It's good to have that close bond with your siblings_comma_ though.
5332,I have a pearl bracelet that I wear on special occasions that I inherited when my grandmother passed away. It always makes me remember her when I wear it.,I bet it's beautiful! Did she wear it often?
5334,Thank you! They really are. Yes she did_comma_ she loved her jewelry.,You're so lucky to have that to remember her by
5336,Our house burned down and my husband lost his 1969 Camaro.,oh my goodness that is horrible!
5338,It happened 7 years ago but with the California fire it brings back a rush of emotions.,I am sure it does. I am really sorry about all of that.
5340,I was in a car accident. Both cars were totaled.,I hope you are ok_comma_ what happened?
5342,They were running from the police. It was nerve rattling.,I can believe so _comma_ Hope you get justice_comma_ and a paycheck!
5344,A dog chased me through our street last night,Damn! was it a stray dog?
5346,I think so.. it looked like that. I was shivering when i finally managed to escape,Dear god.. I hope you are alright my friend!
5348,I got really drunk on my birthday this year_comma_ and couldn't remember what I did. It was very awkward meeting my friends the next day,Oh no_comma_ I've had that happen before_comma_ it is the worst. I hope it wasn't too bad for you!
5350,It wasn't that bad in the end_comma_ but it was the fear of not remembering anything!,I understand that all too well! I'm glad it wasn't too bad though. I've had some pretty embarrassing things happen while hungover.
5352,I can't wait to go to the amusement park again!,That sounds like so much fun!
5354,I think the roller coasters are my favorite thing.,I like the little roller coasters myself.
5356,i felt guilty,about what?
5358,yes meet to,I am sorry? I do not understand
5361,I was trying to get to a loaf of bread in the fridge_comma_ and I knocked over a full tub of my mother in law's chicken corn chowder!,That must have been messy. Were you able to get it all cleaned up?
5363,Yeah but now the kitchen smells like milky soup! My mother in law is going to be a little peeved too_comma_ oops.,I'm sure she's done something like that in the past herself though.
5366,I'm furious_comma_ my wife's brother just wrecked our only car_comma_ and I'm pretty sure he had been drinking!,Oh my god. That's aweful!
5368,Yeah_comma_ I'm mad at them both_comma_ she let him use the car to get more beer!,Well he sounds really irresponsible. I would make him pay for the damages.
5370,I'm supposed to cook dinner tonight but I have no idea what to cook.,Make a pizza_comma_ it is a fail safe choice.
5372,Hmm I suppose I could do that. Can never really go wrong with pizza.,Yes_comma_ pizza with some olive oil and balsamic vinegar dipping.
5374,I am getting a second vacuum from the same company tomorrow and I truly hope it's not a doozy like the first one was!,Good luck_comma_ what was wrong with the first?
5376,The power button didn't work unless I held it in. I really needed a vacuum too so it was a big annoyance to have to send it back!,That's understandable_comma_ I'd send it back as well
5379,I was susprised when my parents let me get my license the day I turned 16_comma_ that is not really like them,Well at 16 you have experienced alot of life and are ready to move on
5381,That is true_comma_ it took a lot of convuincing though,Just be safe out there
5383,I was so nervous to ride that roller coaster_comma_ but my sister was begging me to go.,Oh_comma_ I know that feeling! Did you end up going on the ride?
5385,I did_comma_ and it was scary! But I had a good time!,I'm glad it turned out so well!
5387,I thank God every day for the many blessings. Especially our new home,When did you move in?
5389,5 months ago now. It's really nice here_comma_ there are 3 swimming pools,3!!! Amazing
5391,A while back_comma_ I had a car accident and it broke my ankle. I've recovered since then_comma_ but I've never been able to walk around like I used to. Last week I did my longest walk since the accident though_comma_ so I feel really good about that.,Thats some really good progress right there
5393,Thanks! It's weird because I never really wanted to run or anything before_comma_ but when I realized I might never be able to really run like I used to could_comma_ it really bummed me out.,I guess that could make you regret even the things you never thought og
5395,My friend just sent me a box with bath bombs and a spa kit!,That sounds wonderful! Do you get to use them yet?
5397,Yes! They are awesome and I feel so much better.,I haven't had a chance to try bath bombs yet. But my daughter in-law loves them.
5399,I've been sick and it's been hard to take care of my 3 kids during the day. My husband came home early from work to help out_comma_ I'm so thankful for him.,Being sick does stink at times. But at least your husband is there to assist when in need.
5401,It makes everything a little easier to deal with.,Hopefully your kids also understand and aren't being a handful.
5403,I was doing a morning jog the other day and I ended up stepping in dog poop.,Uggh_comma_ what a buzzkill.
5405,Yea_comma_ I will definitely be paying closer attention to my surroundings from now on.,I'd say that is definitely true for you now.
5407,I wonder what my friend is doing now on the side of the world,Yeah_comma_ me too! Is your friend working abroad too?
5409,No_comma_ she's going to school.,Okay interesting. Well I would guess that she is probably studying right no!
5411,I've been getting really bad headaches recently,Headaches really suck_comma_ I'm so sorry to hear that. Any idea why you've been getting bad ones?
5413,No clue_comma_ maybe it's the lack of sleep? Or maybe I've been in front of my computer for too long,It could be. Also may be related to dehydration_comma_ and eye strain related to visual problems. Try and drink more water and have your eyes checked to be sure!
5415,I got a free giftcard in the mail!,thats quite nice
5417,yes it is! I got to use it on what i wanted too!,thats super awesome
5419,I was really pulling for England during the world cup. Bummer they lost.,Did you have any money bet on it ?

5424,I watched a man eat a 5 pound ham.,oh my god_comma_ thats alot of ham_comma_ Did he throw it up after?

5428,I had a terrifying experience what using the restroom yesterday.,What happened??
5430,As I was sitting on the toilet I kept hearing a scratching noise. When I turned to look a huge waterbug had climbed up the tub wall next to me.,Holy moly! That would have scared me too! Did you kill it?
5432,I tutored my little cousin in math. He made an A on his test. He did so much better than before.,That's great!
5434,Yea I think He will continue to improve. It feels great knowing he can achieve if he tries.,I hope he does!
5436,I am terrified of clowns,I'm not afraid of clown myself_comma_ but I can absolutely see how they can be terrifying to some people!
5438,Yes_comma_ I hate the makeup they wear_comma_ it is just so creepy!,I agree with you. Those painted smiles and big_comma_ red noses can be so off-putting!
5440,I heard on the radio that Beyonce will be performing in my city soon.,That's cool. Are you a big fan of her?
5442,Yes I have enjoyed her music over the years and I like to attend her concerts as well when I can.,That msut be exciting then_comma_ I hope the tickets aren't too expensive.
5444,I can not wait till Christmas.,Especially getting gifts from family. What a special holiday this is
5446,Yes. I always go to my gradnpa's house.,How weird it may seem_comma_ but my mom still gives me children's book as a gift for each Christmas
5448,My mom really helps me with so much_comma_ I can leave my animals in her care if anything happens to me. That is a relief!,She sounds like a great mother! What kind of animals do you have?
5450,Bunnies_comma_ turtle_comma_ dogs and loads of cats :),Wow you're running a vet clinic or something haha! Well it sounds like they are surrounded with love.
5453,When I see little girls around town the past week it makes me remember mine and feel sad but happy.,Where are yours and what's going on withthem?
5455,Mine didn't make it.,So sorry to hear that...wish you blessings and health and peace

5460,I know. i lost my job due to automation in the company.,Yeah_comma_ that sounds no good_comma_ what will you do now?
5462,A few weeks ago_comma_ we had a terrible storm_comma_ and my apartment flooded.,Oh no! Hopefully renters insurance covered it!
5464,None of my or the landlord's insurance covered the damage_comma_ so he's paying for the repairs out of pocket.,Well that is terrible for him but I am glad at least some of it is being taken care of!
5466,Not really_comma_ the repairs were supposed to take three days_comma_ and it's taken over three weeks so far.,Ugg I am sorry to hear that. Sometimes dealing with land lords is a tough business.
5468,I left my wallet in my office today,Can you go back and get it ?
5470,Yes but_comma_ that's like a 24 min drive each way.,Might be worth it_comma_ rather than someone else picking it up.
5473,How can one stay married for 14 years without cheating?,By being a decent person...I'm not a cheater and could never..I am very monogomous..Why would you get married if you wanted that?
5475,Ok_comma_ I think I am just being scared and finding an excuse,I think so. Having integrity and good character would stop you from doing that_comma_ would you want to be cheated on? You should be honest with your partner..or work on and water your relationship if you don't like it the way it is. Cheating after 14 years would truly make you a terrible person to waste someone elses life for 14 years only to go through such a betrayal.
5478,I inherited my grandfather's rifle.,That is awesome! I would love to get something like that from a relative! Does it have any sentimental value?
5480,Yes_comma_ It goes with the rest of the stuff. It's a rifle he hunted with_comma_ and my father hunted with. Now I've got it.,That was so nice that your were chosen to get it and hopefully pass it on again!
5482,My friend has had the flu_comma_ and I have been making sure they get better and that they eat.,That's sweet of you_comma_ the flu is a pretty gnarly sickness to go through. You sound like a good friend!
5484,Aw thank you. He seems to be recovering pretty well_comma_ just whiny.,That's good_comma_ at least he is getting better_comma_ he'll survive!
5486,My daughter won an award at her school for best artist. I was so happy for her.,Sounds amazing! What kind of art does she want to produce?
5488,She likes to work in oils but lately she's been doing sculture too.,Wow. Sculpture. Very impressed.
5491,I am upset with how I acted at work the other day_comma_ I lashed out when I should not have,Oh no_comma_ did you get into trouble with your boss?
5493,Not yet_comma_ but I think I will soon,Ahh_comma_ that's too bad. Just make sure to take responsibility and be very sorry for your actions_comma_ maybe it won't be so bad.
5495,I blurted out an answer in class once only to be dead wrong.,that sucks_comma_ why did you do it?
5497,Because i was sure I was right! i couldnt believe it.,that is such a bomber_comma_ i can relate to thinking you are right but then turning out top be wrong
5499,I went to a court hearing for unemployment with my former employer_comma_ and I felt great about it since I was so prepared with all of the documents and everything I needed to show the court I was in the right for quitting.,Did it go your way?
5501,Yes_comma_ I actually ended up winning it and they gave me 6 months of unemployment pay.,That is great - have you found another job yet?
5504,I remember as a kid when I was mad I would try to break something my parents owned. Looking back_comma_ I feel remorse for what I did.,Tell me exactly what that was like? Hopefully it's different now?
5506,I would just try to break a household item whenever they punished me. Yes it is different now_comma_ I try to control my temper in non violent ways.,I could not even imagine how mad your parents must be.
5509,i hate seeing homeless people,We don't see many here. Do you live in a city?
5511,yes it has been getting bad lately,Well_comma_ the city probably should do something about it.
5513,She found someone else,Uh oh_comma_ that sounds bad. Is it your wife?
5515,No. My girl friend,Do you know who it is?
5518,I went thru my childrens old clothes the other day and its hard to believe they are grown up now.,Oh I understand_comma_ mine is only 2 1/2 right now but I feel that way too when going through his preemie clothes. You probably feel it much more if they are grown though.
5520,I think we probably feel it about the same! It was a nice memory to come across tho.,Yes! Do you keep your favorite things of theirs? I always keep my favorite outfits of his and donate the rest!
5522,There is a co-worker who frequently asks me to help him with his tasks. He is very incompetent and i can't understand how he was hired,thats the same thing happening at my job _comma_ super lazy worker just walks around and hides in the restroom its annoying
5524,I think all the blame lies on supervisors who hire such incompetent people who only hinder the work performance and pace,yes it does_comma_ i wish people like that would just get fired
5526,I am sad that my parents didn't attend my birthday,Do they live in a different state than you?
5528,No_comma_ they just are not wanting to come to it,Sorry to hear that. Remember those who mind don't matter and those who matter don't mind
5530,So I forgot to get my son a bag of chips from the store today.,Was he upset?
5532,"He kinda gave me the ""Mom_comma_ really?"" look but I told him that we'd ride to the store in the morning b/c I looked around the kitchen and realized there was other stuff I forgot. *chuckle*",I hate when that happens.
5534,I do_comma_ too. I tend to get 'mom brain' at the worst times! I'll be happy when he is old enough to get his own chips [he's 14 now].,I hate ggrocery shopping period. Too many decisions
5536,It's easier with a list but still_comma_ you always remember the one thing off of the list and then it turns into TEN things off of the list. XD,You are so right.
5538,I was ashamed when I got in trouble with the law. I was more ashamed of what my dad was going to think.,It must have been embarrassing. Hope it ended well for you.
5540,I am here now thankfully_comma_ it was a learning experience for sure.,I'm happy for you.
5542,My friend lost her job. I'm glad she paid off her home though,That's too bad. Maybe she will find a new one soon.
5544,I hope so_comma_ too. In the meantime_comma_ at least she doesn't have any big expenses.,That's always a plus. I am sure that will make the search less stressful.
5546,My neighbor was robbed at home last week. Since then_comma_ she has been too scared to stay by herself. We let her stay with us for a couple of nights.,That sounds terrifying! I wouldn't want to stay alone either. That was nice you guys took her in.
5548,She was a nervous wreck and we felt like it was a good idea for her to have some friends around for a while.,I don't blame her. I am sure she felt more at ease staying with you guys.
5550,I'm meeting my online girlfriend for the first time this weekend,Wow_comma_ that's a huge step. Are you excited?
5552,I am very excited. I hope I don't goof up in front of her!,I'm sure it'll be amazing

5556,well if at the end of the season you win it all_comma_ you get about 2 grand!,That's a lot of money. Best of luck to you!
5558,I was so anxious for my kid to graduate,I can understand that. Did it end up going ok?
5560,It did. I'm very proud of him,That's good. I'm glad everything worked out.
5562,I was really expectant anyway,What were you expecting?
5564,That i will get the job,You sound confident. Did the interview go that well?
5566,I feel so thankful for my mother-in-law. She recently sent us a great feast of food out of the blue.,Wow_comma_ how nice. Is she always doing nice things?
5568,She does actually_comma_ and very randomly! Which I love and find to be kind of unique.,Wow_comma_ you are lucky to have someone like that in your life. That's rare.
5570,I was bathing my dog in the backyard this weekend_comma_ and she got loose. She then went and rolled in the dirt getting extra filthy.,That must of been terrible.
5572,It WAS. Since she was wet_comma_ the dirt got stuck inside her fur. She was even harder to clean the second time around.,Did anyone help you?
5574,My sister just got her dream job basically.,Oh that's great! What job is it?
5576,It's a partner position at a law firm!,She must be really smart!

5580,It was a marathon.,Oh wow! Do you do a lot of marathons?
5582,My husband took our infant out into the world by himself today. There are so many things that could go wrong,That's nerve wracking. I have 4 kids myself so I know what its like.
5584,You have to have faith that they can handle any situation. Thankfully_comma_ he did well,Most of the time they do do well. We definitely have to trust our husbands to look after the little ones without us.
5587,I remember the first I got pooped on while changing my kids diapers.,It must have been an overwhelming experience_comma_ how old are the kids now?
5589,They are 14 and 12. It was pretty gross_comma_ but you have to deal with a lot of gross things when they are babies and just remember that you can take a shower to wash it off. Luckily they have cute little faces to help you forget about the gross things.,Sweet_comma_ we all miss those memories of them growing back. Mine are adults now
5591,I studied so hard for my test.,Oh yeah? I hope you did well?
5593,I did amazing_comma_ got a 95%_comma_ so surprised!,Good for you!
5595,Before signing the contract_comma_ the landlord made promises that he will do some reparations but he never kept his word.,What a bummer. Landlords suck for the most part.
5597,I agree with you. I am looking to move now. I don't want to deal with him.,Do you have a lease?
5599,I went zip-lining in Thailand once. A nearby tree fell and part of it hit the platform we were on.,Oh my that sounds so scary! Was everyone ok?
5601,We were all fine. A bit shaken up_comma_ but nobody got hurt thank goodness.,Do you think you will ever zip line again?
5604,I took $5 out of my 5 year old's birthday stash yesterday.,What did you use the $5 for? Something good hopefully!
5606,Yeah_comma_ I bought a $5 lotto ticket. I was feeling lucky and I really need to scrounge up enough money for rent this month. We didn't win_comma_ though.,Sorry to hear that. You tried at least and your intentions were good.
5608,I got caught by the train and it made me late for work. I was so mad.,maybe go earlier later?
5610,That's just it though. You never know when the train is going to be there.,oh_comma_ that's kind of weird
5612,i bought all my school supplies for this semester already. I think I am good to go,you are prepared more than ever !
5614,i hope so! I'm ready to kick butt,that's the spirit! always believe in yourself!
5616,I am so mad at the republicans.,Do you think they are messing up the country?
5618,It is mostly Trump.I am mad because they will not stand up to Trump.,Yeah they feed off of his crazy I think.
5620,The other day I was getting a glass out the cabinet and There sat a spider,Ew_comma_ I hate spiders. We are in the process of getting them out of our garage.
5622,I hate the little things too! It was IN the glass at that!,Oh no_comma_ throw it away!!!!
5624,My 12 year old cat passed away last weekend.,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you had your cat a long time?
5626,Yea I got her when she was a kitten 12 years ago. It has been a rough week for me.,I bet it has. They become a part of the family and it can be hard to let go
5628,I'd never had a new car_comma_ always used. And when I say used_comma_ I mean 1973 VW Bug_comma_ no heat_comma_ no air_comma_ in Atlanta traffic. That was until I got married.,Well hello fellow Atlanta person. I also buy used_comma_ but most people tend to look down on it
5630,My husband gave me a brand new car for a wedding present! We've now been married 22 years and it was the ONLY new car we've ever bought - LOL! While I loved it_comma_ it's better use of our money to buy used_comma_ but it took us a little while to realize that.,If you keep a new car long enough it comes out about even! If you keep that in mind then a new car actually becomes a great investment!
5632,Once when I was younger I went to a friends 16th birthday and had a crazy experiene happen,What happened?

5636,I went camping the other day and had a rlly bad experience during it.,Why what happened?

5640,I'm pretty satisfied with all the house work I got done today. Yard is mowed and the house is clean!,That's great_comma_ I wish I had been that productive today. Maybe I still have time for a load of laundry. Good job_comma_ you.
5642,Thanks! You should! Better now than tomorrow is my motto!,I just haven't been feeling too great today. Maybe your right though an easy task might make me feel better and get a head start for tomorrow.
5644,Every single person I know got to go on a vacation this year except for me.,I'm so sorry to hear that. Is there a reason why you couldn't?
5646,I just don't have the funds or time away from work. Even my sister and her husband_comma_ who are as broke as me_comma_ went on one.,To be fair_comma_ travelling is expensive and probably overrated to a certain extent. I hope you do find the time to take some time away from work so you can enjoy yourself though.
5648,I have interviews next week,Is it for a job?

At this point me and the other employees are planning on taking it to corporate to get this resolved.,Ohhhhhhh_comma_ yeah that's really hard on everyone then. Taking it to corporate would be a good idea to help the company and the workers_comma_ if you need to vent out any more frustrations_comma_ just let me know!

5726,It is funny how you can be going through life thinking everything is great_comma_ and then one day you find a nude of another dude that isn't you on your wife's computer. Makes for a wonderful day!,yes_comma_ i understood the first time.
5729,An old friend wanted to get together. IT was a guy_comma_ and he was someone I was involved with. I knew it would bother my husband so I didn't meet with him.,That's the best decision. I know mine wouldn't either. If he is a good guy_comma_ he will understand.
5731,I didn't want to make my husband uncomfortable_comma_ even if it would have been nice to catch up. But I have to respect him.,That's good. No sense in rocking the boat.

I knew this wasn't true since I had known this person for years_comma_ but the night came to a close and we got a cab home.

She had told me she loved me. But in our final conversation_comma_ she denied ever having said so.,That is really mean. I am sorry.
5771,It was a long time ago. It took a long time to get over her_comma_ though. I've never again been as deeply in love as I was with her.,That is so sad. Have you seen or heard from her again?
5774,madden came out today_comma_ i was so stoked,I love Madden_comma_ I can't wait to play it!
5776,it is the best one they have made in years,I am so jealous!

5791,I'm going to be really upset if I get passed over for another promotion. I've paid my dues.,That is so hard_comma_ to feel like you've been looked over. Have you been able to have conversations with leadership as to why that might be the case?
5793,Yeah_comma_ but nothing seems to change. After you talk to them things go back to normal and other people get rewarded.,Does that make you curious to look elsewhere? It sounds like it's maybe not the best place?

5815,So_comma_ is it wrong to not want your child to join a sport because you just don't want to have to take them to practices?,Haha! No! It's not wrong! My son played travel baseball for 6 years and we spent 6 days a week at the ballfields!
5817,That sounds awful! I feel a bit ashamed_comma_ but I really just want to talk him out of doing it.,It's a huge commitment for him and you! If you don't think you can do it_comma_ I wouldn't sign him up. There's no shame in that!

I was supposed to get it tomorrow and there is no way that I will get it on time. I just don't know what to do now.,Oh no_comma_ that's awful. Maybe you can find something else to give her for her birthday but tell her you have another present that will arrive a little later.
5895,I had an email telling me I had a $124 gift voucher this morning,Was it real?
5897,Haha that was my first thought too. It actually was!,That's awesome. What are you going to buy?

5974,I went to comic-con this year.. i felt like i was a child all over again,How expensive is that to go to?
5976,Depends on where you live. I spent 1444 bucks on it,That is not too bad if you had a good time though
5978,I finally saved enough money for a used car. It was a lot of effort but I'm glad I finally can drive again.,Oh_comma_ that's pretty cool_comma_ how long did it took?

6440,They got really angry and started scolding me for wasting their money. I am so embarrassed I can't even leave my room.,Wow I'm sorry you went through that. Not your fault_comma_ it happens

6465,I always get nervous in these situations#,Just remember that it is only one interview.
6467,I think my daughter is going to always like school.,That's a good thing. A lot of people (like me!) hate/hated it. She'll do so much better if she's happy.
6469,Its all she talks about and she runs there in the mornings. I have to keep up,How old is she? Is she studying something she can use later in life?
6471,Oh she is only 5. Its just wishful thinking,Oh_comma_ well goodness_comma_ encourage her! The sooner she starts learning to love to learn the more joy she'll get out of it!
6473,I hope she keeps it up. Kindergarten isnt the same as 7th grade lol,No_comma_ it certainly isn't! Hopefully_comma_ she'll keep loving it and will love learning for the rest of her life. Think what a gift that must be!
6475,i bought some jeans today. I thought the were so cute.,I only wear shorts!
6477,I wish. Well I wont be wearing these jeans anyway. The zipper is broken.,I would try and just wear shorts!
6479,Ok. Ill do that,On christmas morning_comma_ I got everything I wanted.
6482,i am sad because my brother failed me.,what did he do yolo?
6484,he couldn't keep his promise with me. he said he was going to get me pepsi max but he didn't and that made me sad.,this is absolutely the worst! he is no man in my eyes!
6486,I came home the other day to find that my daughter had made all the beds in the house! She is 6.,Wow_comma_ that's incredible. I don't even make my own bed.
6488,haha me either most days! I was really proud of her and then she said she wanted more chore money! lol,Of course... haha. Why doesn't anyone pay adults to make their beds?
6490,My in-laws just suddenly showed up yesterday and said they were staying for the week. I had no warning at all but I guess they were trying to make it fun_comma_ ha ha.,Oh no! I would have a heart attack! Are you able to take time away from life so unexpectedly to spend time with them?
6492,Not really_comma_ but my husband is going to try to get some time off if he can. Its hard in the summer since so many other people at his work have planned vacations. I did have a heart attck and ran around like a crazy person cleaning upstairs before they came up.,hahaha I would have been like a mad woman trying to clean too! I hope it works out and your husband can take time off!

6508,Yes_comma_ it's both. I got a chickpea curry with basmati rice that a local Indian lady made. And a bag of dragon tongue beans_comma_ which are delicious!,Dragon tongue beans! I've never heard of them! What do they look like?
6510,They're the same shape as regular green beans_comma_ but lighter in color and they have red streaks through them. You treat them as you would green beans.,I will have to look for those. We have a huge variety of foods where I live_comma_ but this is new to me.
6512,What I love about this store is it sources all of its produce locally and its all organic. So you get some strange_comma_ different things to try!,It sounds amazing! Are the prices good?

6516,I was able to make a 95. I studied really hard to get that.,Oh wow_comma_ that is great

6520,Indeed. I feel that it is very important to stay caught up on the latest developments. And the potential for a raise isn't a bad motivator either.,I hope you get your promotion.
6522,How believable do you think this is when you run into your old school mate outside the country,i think that would be very unbelievable to run into someone out the country especially from school. Has that ever happened to you?
6524,Of course yes_comma_ that is what i just said happened to me. It really caught me unaware,wow that is awesome where you good friends with them or you just saw them in the halls alot?
6526,My landlord didn't want to repair the ceiling. He take the rent but he doesn't want to make any reparations.,I would be so frustrated. Do you have any way to make him do the necessary fixes?
6528,I can sue him but it can be a very long process. I am looking to move to another appartment. This is making very mad.,I don't blame you! It might cost more to sue than to break the lease and move.
6530,I won the opportunity to go up in a hot air balloon. Wonder who I should take with me.,Any gf or bf? That would be scary yet wonderful!
6532,Nope. Living the single life. Might take family or a friend.,I would take someone who would be thrilled about it :)

6553,Yes_comma_ but I always see people drowning on the news.,just gotta be careful where you swim
6555,I am feeling a bit left out since I moved to a new country.,Oh_comma_ I'm sorry. Have you tried joining any meet up groups to make some friends?
6557,Not yet_comma_ but that is a good idea. I just really need to meet some new people I think.,I'm sure it will make you feel a little better. And at least that way you can pick a group based on similar interest. I hope you get to feeling better.
6559,I ran a mile in under 6 minutes for the first time,What! That seems really fast! Did you train alot? That is amazing!
6561,I've been working on it for a few months now.,You must feel really good about yourself! I would be if I could do that.
6563,At the time there was a friend that told me that i couldn't jump over him_comma_ then i jumped over him.,What were you standing on? Just the ground?

6567,Yes they do happen to be designed by Kanye. They fund the rich life style of the Wests and pay their water bill.,I have heard water is expensive in California. Well _comma_ they are worth it if you can jump straight up five or six feet.

6571,I applied for my dream job last week.,Oh cool! What would that be?

6575,Can't wait to go the movies tonight with my family_comma_ I love family movie night!,That sounds really great! What movie are you going to see?
6577,We are going to see Hotel Transylvania_comma_ I heard it was a great family movie.,It really is! I hope that you have a good time!
6579,He was sitting on a perch looking hungry. He asked for money but I didnt have any so I gave his a slice of pizza and he cursed me out.,That is terrible. Probably_comma_ he wanted money to buy drugs.
6581,His teeth were missing so maybe he couldnt eat the pzza,It could be a good explanation but he shouldn't have cursed.
6584,I cant wait for school to start for me.,Most people are dreading it. How come you're looking forward to it?
6586,Its my last year. I am almost done!,Oh yea! Congratulations!

6607,Yes_comma_ but I was quite late. and got yelled at by my teacher.,She didn't have to yell
6609,It's feel so strange going from a household of 8 and now down to 5 with 2 almost ready to leave. My youngest just started high school. I imagine 4 more years and it will be just me.,Won't you enjoy less chaos?
6611,Definitely_comma_ you have a good point there. I love my peaceful moments. I just have very brief moments when I think of them all at home.,The kids can always visit you.

6835,A few years ago_comma_ I became friends with someone through an online video game. Eventually we trusted each other_comma_ so we met up in person!,I know a lot of people in real life through that kind of stuff. Has been pretty great for me after 11 years. How is it for you so far.
6837,I'd say it's going pretty well_comma_ we eventually got married! How did you meet your friends?,Well we met through going to conventions and i even visited some myself. Really great bunch of people and i see places.

6848,I was home alone while my husband went on a business trip,Oh_comma_ were you lonely? You must have missed him. Was he gone long?
6850,I was. We dont have any animals either.,My husband used to travel on his job a lot. It was hard at first_comma_ but I got used to it after some time. Maybe you can get your girlfriend to come over?
6852,i would fear my gift,tell me more about this
6854,my partner gave me a an i phone it is very memorable and pleasure to me,if its an older iphone i would treasure it
6856,yes but its a valuable gift to me,everyone values things differently
6859,My husband and I recently decided we are going to get a puppy! I was really excited when I put the deposit down_comma_ but when I went to tell my mom about it she got really negative and talked badly about our decision. It was really frustrating and made me not feel great.,What was she so negative?
6861,The dog breed we decided on is a rather large one and she was worried that we hadn't done our research. We have young children so she was concerned we didn't think about them first.,What kind of dog is it?
6863,We rode in the cab_comma_ and my friend looks at me with the most serious face and tells me they are Bi-Sexual. Though they said they usually only date the same sex and they hadn't ever told anyone about it.,Your friend must trust and care for you a lot to confide in you like that. how did you react?
6865,I told them that it didn't matter to me_comma_ and I still loved them like family.,That's good. you must have been surprised by the confession.
6867,When I was younger I decided to plummet down a sheer-drop water-slide. As I approached_comma_ I almost chickened-out_comma_ I was so nervous.,Please tell me you went through with it. That sounds like it would have been an experience!
6869,I did in the end! The people queuing behind must have been furious as I trembled and delayed. It was excellent_comma_ and terrifying!,They've should have had similar feelings_comma_ so they should have been more understanding.

6879,love getting together with my brother and reminiscing about when we were younger,Things were much simpler when we were kids. You are your brother must have a close relationship.
6881,We do but we donÃ¢Â€Â™t see each other often enough,I'm sorry to hear that. I guess it makes the times you do see each other even more special!
6883,My kids wouldn't clean their room yesterday. I was quite displeased.,Oh no_comma_ I hope you pardon them.
6885,I shan't! I will put them up for adoption on the morrow!,This is too much of punishment for kids.
6887,I went to the lake in my old neighborhood and thought about my childhood buddies.,How was that? Must have been a throwback!
6889,It definitely was. I don't have a lot of friends now and miss them a lot.,I am sorry to hear that_comma_ hope you get some more?

6893,I did appreciate getting the experience of interviewing at the company. But I was even more upset when I found out the job went to a recent college graduate with no experience!,That is not fair for employers to count education more than life experience.
6895,One time my mom made me lunch when I was too busy working!,Wow that is so sweet of her. She must really love you!
6897,I hope so! She always helps me and one day I will return the favor!,Wow that is fantastic_comma_ she is so lucky to have you around because you are such a sweet and caring person. :)
6899,I had to teach an inservice class at work. I went over all of my notes very carefully,Did it go well for you then?
6901,Quite well. I was ready for any question that was asked of me.,It's great when it works out that way_comma_ I hate presenting.
6903,When I shop online for computer parts_comma_ I like to use newegg because I am confident their items will ship fast and on time.,I have never used newegg before_comma_ and I think that sounds like that are very good at what they do. I might have to check them out!
6905,They are great! Have been around for a very long time and I've bought from them since I was a teenager.,I will have to check out newegg based on your recommendation. They sound fantastic so thanks!!
6907,I just had a pretty good meal at the Olive Garden.,Right on_comma_ that sounds cool. Did you go with family_comma_ or a date? Or maybe just hung out there alone? That's okay_comma_ too. I love Italian food_comma_ had always wanted to go to Olive Garden_comma_ but my dad hates Italian. So when we were growing up_comma_ we just never went. Now that I'm on my own_comma_ I've been... twice. Both times_comma_ they were just okay.
6909,Yeah_comma_ it wasn't great but I was satisfied. I went with friends.,It can be cheap to go there sometimes for an easy filling meal_comma_ with the deals and coupons they have_comma_ I think. With the bread and soup you can get. I hope you guys had a good time!

6919,I had the worst experience last weekend. I woke up to find someone had stolen my car! I was in absolute shock just couldnt believe it.,Thats horrible! Did you get the police involved?
6921,Well yes. While i was in my daze_comma_ absolutely horrified_comma_ my level headed husband did all the practical things like contact the police and insurance company etc.,Yeah i would have felt the same way.
6923,Thankfully the insurance company sorted my out with a courtesy car for now but still cant believe there are people out there that do such terrible things!,yeah it unfortunate we have to worry about things like this.
6926,I love my new puppy! He's so sweet_comma_ and I am happy I got him from an adoption rescue.,That is a very noble gesture. Congratulations!

6944,I lost my mother recently_comma_ she was sick with hypertension and diabetics,I am sorry to hear that.
6946,I can't get over it_comma_ I cry all the time.,It must be very difficult for you. Do you have someone you can talk to about it? I find that remembering the good times helps you keep their memory alive.
6948,I try to treasure the memories that we have. I keep close to family members as well.,That's great. It's nice to have family around that can help pick you up when you feel down.
6951,I've been through a lot of hard times in life_comma_ but I know that God will bless me soon.,i bet he will_comma_ everything always gets better dont worry
6953,Thank you for that encouragement. I am trying to be as patient as I can be during these hard times.,like some one once said_comma_ time heals everything just have a positive attitude

6998,Do you ever wake up and realize how lucky we are? I travel a lot and I just got back from Haiti. I'm convinced it's better to be poor in America then rich in Haiti.,"That's a profound thought. We definitely take America for granted_comma_ especially when some people say it's in its ""worst state in a long time."" We're prisoners of the moment."
7000,Those that criticize have not traveled the real world out side resort gates or into the third world. Then you see a real state that is in trouble.,Yeah_comma_ I guess you would know for sure_comma_ since you've seen it first hand. Especially a place like Haiti_comma_ that's just gets pounded with hurricanes. What brought you to Haiti_comma_ if you don't mind me asking?

7013,Oh well that's just spoiling it for herself haha.,Nope she still reads it all. Same thing you do silly! lol
7015,When i proposed to my girlfriend_comma_ she said yes! I was so happy,well that's great news congratulations_comma_ how long have you known each other?

7023,I awoke to someone banging on my door in the middle of the night. By the time I got to the door I couldnt see anyone out there. I was so scared.,Did you call the police?
7025,No but if it happens again I will. I ordered a camera for my porch. I couldnt get any sleep that night.,Do you live in a house or an apartment?
7027,I'm very socially awkward and tomorrow i'm going to have a playdate with some local moms and i'm so anxious,"I'm right there with you.. I still feel pretty introverted_comma_ but since coming to college_comma_ I've been forced to socialize more_comma_ and it's help me at least ""fake it until I make it."" I still prefer to be alone a lot of the time_comma_ but at least I can somewhat manage without making myself look dumb. Maybe you can just think of some topics/things to talk about to have in the back of your head for the times when things get quiet?"
7029,that's a great idea! thank you for a great advice.,I hope it goes well! If it makes you feel any better_comma_ most of them are probably just as nervous and are looking for any excuse to relax and let their guard down_comma_ too. Good luck
7031,When I can't take a breather in the day I feel suffocated,Yea_comma_ its a good idea to take time for yourself when you can
7033,Right_comma_ it's like I can't focus or relax,I think relaxing is very important
7035,I was walking home from work late a few weeks ago and my street was unusually quiet.,What happened?
7037,Well_comma_ there was a man walking really quickly behind me and there was no one around.,Sounds a bit scary. What did you do?
7039,I panicked and he caught up. He walked by quickly and said a really nasty word in the creepiest way. But he kept going. My knees were shaking.,Oh my goodness I would have been terrified!
7041,Yes_comma_ it was so scary. My heart pounded for at least half an hour. I was shaken.,Thankfully he walked on past you but what a horrible experience all round.
7043,I had a rather unnerving experience this past winter. Being unable to sleep at 4am_comma_ I went outside for a cigarette (I live in an apartment complex).

7052,Mom's going to be mad_comma_ I stole some dinosaur toys,Maybe she will go easy on you_comma_ if this isn't something you do often.

7057,I just finished a major project at work for a client,Awesome! Can you say what kind of project it is?

7061,i felt anxious during my work. the finance related work which gives me satisfaction,Why did you feel anxious?
7063,i love my job. i eagerly awaited to achieve and go as long as i want in my life.,Hmm.. I'm a little confused. Why were you anxious?
7066,This year has been the worst for rains and flooding. My house was recently affected and heavily damaged.,Im sorry to hear that do you have insurance to help you?
7068,Absolutely thank goodness. Without it I dont know what I would have done.,Yeah well im glad you atleast have that to help you

7075,I was looking through some of my old pictures a week or so ago_comma_ and saw a picture of my grandmother who passed away a few years ago,I'm sorry to hear that. Were you two very close?
7077,Yes_comma_ we were. I used to spend my summer vacations with her when my parents were out of town_comma_ so it allowed me to get really close with her.,That's sweet_comma_ I had the same experience with my own grandma too. God bless y'all!
7079,I remember when fast food used to be really cheap.,Yes_comma_ and you didn't have to always buy items for the extra value menu.
7081,Absolutely! Those were the good old days.,Those are the good old days. Have to use coupons these days!
7083,Some girls can just breakup with you for no reason,I think there must be a reason for that
7085,I tried to ask but she refused to say anything. I guess she got a better guy,Oh_comma_thats life_comma_so sorry for that
7087,We live in an area that gets hurricanes. When one was coming_comma_ we got flashlights_comma_ batteries and everything you need.,its always good to be prepared. I live in an area that gets hurricanes too. I've even got a generator.
7089,That is great. We lost power for a week during one and it was horrible!,Last hurricane I was without power for a whole month. It was miserable.
7091,I was trying to take a nap the other day and my neighbor wouldn't shut her tiny barky dog up.,I totally feel you on that. I swear my neighbors have to be the loudest at night slamming their car doors and yelling outside right in front of my bedroom window.
7093,Ugh_comma_ that's the worst. Thankfully we're on the second floor so we don't have to deal with car noise too much.,My bedroom is first floor_comma_ and literally maybe 4 feet from the parking lot. Lucky me. Lucky you tho too with animals. lol

7633,It is. I hope everything is going to be okay with her. I have been waiting to hear back from them.,Me too. That was very nice of what you did for that dog.

7638,No_comma_ compared to what I would pay for another place to do it it was cheap. Plus they always have a cool waiting room with snacks,They do always have snacks.
7640,I can't find another way to earn money,There are usually many ways_comma_ but it depends on what you want to do!
7642,I just want to work from home,Well_comma_ we all want to work from home but it takes a lot of work and sweat to make that a reality for most of us

7658,No kidding! I don't see how those kind of people are still around. No. It had already escalated by the time I saw it. We figured it was best to just keep moving.,That might be for the best. Were they arguing about her color or something else?
7660,No. She just thought the other woman wasnt doing her job. Classic sense of entitlement.,Thats really annoying. It would be great if people would just let other people be.
7662,I dropped my allstart team trophy and it shattered everywhere,Dang_comma_ that really blows. What was it made of_comma_ glass?
7664,some sort of ceramic material.,They should use metal. That never breaks. Sorry that happened to you.

7672,He had just been busy with life. But he was at my house when I got home for work.,Oh that is a nice surprise. I bet you caught up with each other.

7680,They ran some tests and could not pin point what was wrong so he is just taken it easy. I decided to take a weekend and go over and finish the garden. He was pretty happy about that.,That's good. I'm glad it wasn't something urgent and he got to finish in the garden.
7683,I was walking my dog and a stray dog ran up to us and started barking. Next thing I know he was trying to fight with my dog.,That's so scary! I hope your dog is OK.
7685,It was_comma_ I have always been uneasy around fighting animals.She is fine. Took me a bit to calm myself down.,I can imagine. Glad you are both alright.
7687,I am so scared to live in my neighborhood. There is people that come around shooting their guns.,That sounds dangerous! You should try to move

I've been yelling at him off and on recently since he started living with my family for a short period of time. It's so hard to keep my patience in the moment... But then later on I feel so terrible that I can't be a better human being to him.,I think it's an adjustment you have to work through. Toddlers can really test anyone's patience!
7702,Yeah. I'm trying to handle myself better. It's hard when you're arguing with the child about the same thing_comma_ every day_comma_ day after day. It feels like running into a wall. You want to teach them_comma_ but they don't listen_comma_ or they don't show improvement. And obviously it's because he's two and he's just going to naturally take time to develop. But in the meantime_comma_ I struggle to not overreact.,It's really hard_comma_ especially being thrown into an environment with a two year old and not having them for a consistent basis from when they were younger up until now.
7704,I'm starting a new job next week_comma_ and while I am excited_comma_ I am also very nervous!,Congratulations! Don't be too nervous! You must have done something right to get the job in the first place!

7716,I went to a new restaurant last friday and they asked what sauce i would like my food to be cooked with _comma_ i said give me the spice dragon thinking it was gonna be hot _comma_ it was sweet and tangy i only ate a bit and left the rest there,Oh wow_comma_ that's disappointing!
7718,it really was _comma_ i really dont like sweet food at all_comma_ i cant even stand candy,I'm really sorry to hear that!
7720,I am so sad. My 3 dogs attacked my baby goat and she died last night from the injuries. Crying....,Aww_comma_ that's so sad. I'm an animal lover so I understand the pain.
7722,It hurts really bad and I don't know what to do. I think I should give some dogs away to a family with no small animals.,That's a really tough decision either way. I wish you the best with it and hope everything improves

7738,I was mad when my friend skipped my moms funeral. It was just a sad time,Wow what did they say about skipping it?
7740,He said he was sick_comma_ but that was not true,probably won't forgive him for a long time.
7742,A loud boom went off tonight. Scared me to death.,Wow that would scare me too. What caused it?
7744,Another gunshot likely. Sometimes it's hard to tell- they aren't allowed legally to do fireworks here except on the day of...but they do the bomb one sometimes :/ It's scary as often it IS gunshots...I'm in the ghetto.,Sorry to hear that you're in that situation. Hope you stay safe
7746,My mom and grandma were supposed to visit last week but cancelled last minute.,Oh no. What happened?
7748,My mom said she had to go to work but I'm not sure I believe her.,Must feel terrible. Well_comma_ at least_comma_ you don't have to look after them then.
7751,So last time I was at my parents I decided to drive through my old neighborhood growing up. The field we used to play sports was still there. I cant stop thinking about how much fun we had there.,Must have been really nostalgic. Did you think about going to play on that field again?
7753,I did. but it was cold out so I just drove by. I wonder if some of my old friends parents still live around there. That was a good time. Being young and playing with friends.,Childhood seems to be a great time for most_comma_ but then we wanted to grow up too fast.

7763,A gal my sister knew from highschool (old friend) works in a thrift store I like and today I just didn't feel good and didn't feel like talking to her.,that's sad_comma_ bad memories ?
7765,Yes for sure..She always wants to talk to me incessantly about everything in her life..she was never nice to me as a kid_comma_ and I just went through a huge tragedy she hasn't said a word about. I still felt a little bad because she still gave my mom a discount and a discount on my stuff- my mom went through checkout for me as I just wasn't up too it. I don't feel like talking to people a lot you know?,yeah i understand you_comma_ but people change and we learn from them and that helps us grow more_comma_ don't take it too personally
7767,I am so looking forward to the next Avatar sequel. It seems like I have been waiting forever. I am growing impatient.,Avatar the Airbender or James Cameroons Avatar?

7788,My wife left me and I have no one else.,I am so sorry to hear that.
7790,Yes_comma_ she didn't even give me a reason why.,That must be tough. Do you have supportive friends to help you through this tough time?

7804,I am so angry my co-worker stole from me yesterday. How could they do this to me...,What was it that they stole from you there?
7806,My YMCA membership card and some of office supplies. I've let my co-worker borrow that stuff a couple times but now they feel entitled to it so they steal from me I guess.,If they feel entitled though then maybe they are thinking that all is normal?
7808,I took money from my daughter's piggy bank.,Not cool! Why did you do that?
7810,I needed beer money. I feel so guilty about it.,As you should! You should put back the money that you stole.

I have been devastated by the loss of pets in the past_comma_ so I can understand what you're going through. I'm sure she was very loved and had a great life with you and your family.

7902,I have to give a speech at my fathers funeral. I drew the short straw.,It must have been a very difficult speech_comma_ specially since I imagine you were really sad and moved.
7904,Not really_comma_ I just needed to make sure that It goes off without a hitch. I don't want to embarrass my Mother.,Of course_comma_ do you feel prepared to do it then?
7906,I asked my friend to get some stuff for a party_comma_ I knew I could count on him though.,I'm jealous of you. I'm a little introverted and antisocial_comma_ and never got good at developing friendships where I could make them long-lasting and trustworthy. Good for you
7908,I understand_comma_ I'm a bit introverted myself_comma_ it gets easier the more you do it though.,"Yeah_comma_ since I've been in college_comma_ I've been forced to socialize more and I'm getting better at it.

7918,My friend adopted a really elderly dog. I'm so proud of her.,Oh that's nice! Most people don't adopt older dogs
7920,Yea_comma_ they don't. They're probably afraid of loss and of course_comma_ the medical bills.,Mostly medical. But_comma_ also that you most likely won't have long to make a bond_comma_ play_comma_ etc. It would be mostly care
7922,I realized a while ago_comma_ that it is good if you are not afraid of fear.,What made you realize that? You can't live in fear

7936,I hope so_comma_ i miss sleeping in a comfortable position without baby feet in my face,I'm not looking forward to it when I have a kid! I can't function without a good 8 hours of sleep.

7942,Man_comma_ I know it's for the best_comma_ but I don't know if I'm ready to join the Air Force.,what is making you have second thoughts?
7944,Well_comma_ I just don't know if I'm physically fit enough for Basic Training. And it's hard imagining signing a contract for 4 years. But_comma_ I know it'll be better in the end_comma_ it'll set me up with a good job and good work experience.,there are other options in life but you must always follow your heart when making such important decisions.
7946,I was upset when my favorite TV show was canceled. Now I don't have anything to watch.,Well thats disappointing. Maybe you can find a show similar to it to watch.
7948,I will look but I hate it when they cancel good shows. It seems to happen too often.,I know what you mean. It seems they keep the crap shows going for years and the good ones get cancelled.
7950,I thought I heard an animal trapped under my house last night.,Oh yeah? What kind of animal do you think it was?
7952,I think it might have been something large. There was a lot of noise and scratching.,Maybe it was an armadillo. I get them in my yard sometimes.

7969,Everyone applauded me,That must feel amazing! What did you do to deserve the recognition?

7975,Yep since i was 3! Was a nice time the streets of DC flooded with people celebrating a championship finally for the team.,That is awesome! I am from Chicago_comma_ so when the cubs won the world series I felt the same way.
7977,I go out with one of my friend. This friend is so cheap that he doesn't to pay for anything. He even once embarrassed me in a bar.,That sounds frustrating_comma_ especially if they are inconsiderate and drain you of your funds. They sound kind of entitled.
7979,He asked the barman if he can bring his drinks from home. I was so embarrassed.,Oh wow_comma_ that must be embarrassing to deal with. Sounds like they are going through a financial situation_comma_ but they should at least talk to you about it since you two are friends.
7981,My neighbors decided to have a party last night and they played loud music until 1 AM. It really got on my nerves.,Oh I bet you wanted to over there and yell at them. Some people are so inconsiderate.
7983,And this is not the first time either. You are right_comma_ so people are very selfish and it is frusterating.,If it is too bad you should file a noise complaint with the police. Sometimes that is the only way to get the message across.
7985,I walked to an apartment and it took me a while to realize I was in the wrong apartment.,Uh oh. Was someone in there?
7987,They were all asleep. That's pretty dangerous for them.,Oh wow! That is kind of scary.
7989,I was so happy for my son when he won the state championship for tennis,That's great! Congratulations and well done. He must practice long and hard to get to that stage in the game.

I dont think I would ever get rid of them
8017,ended up getting a pizza from Costco. I'm so hungry,Oh man_comma_ Costco pizza is great_comma_ and so cheap_comma_ too. It may not be the best_comma_ but for the price and quantity_comma_ you can't really beat it. Do you like shopping at Costco often?
8019,Not really. I kinda feel like I don't get much_comma_ but their food court stuff is great value for the money.,Yeah_comma_ I guess it depends on your household. I just tag along with my parents from time to time to get certain things in bulk. But I think you need to have a certain amount of people in your family for it to be worth the membership. Still_comma_ I really appreciate the business and the owner as a whole.
8021,when i get payed i usually go to my go to restaurant places _comma_ i avoid fast food since they always get my orders wrong_comma_ so when new restaurants open i tend to avoid them until i see good reviews,Yeah the new places are always really busy when they first open too!

8041,Stupid stubborn people are....the worst. Like_comma_ Stupid people still have hope_comma_ you can convince them if they are humble enough...but a stupid person with an ego is like trying to wash dishes with cat piss and horse sh*t,know it all people drive me nuts too
8043,Yes there has to be a balance,people need to learn and be humble honeslty
8045,I am mad at my brother because he broke my bike. He always want to use my stuff and he ends up breaking it.,Uh oh! Are you going to ask him to pay for it? Or at least fix it?
8047,He is never going to pay or fix it. I already asked him for something else that he broke. He never did pay or fix it.,Might be time to just stop letting him use your stuff_comma_ unfortunately.
8049,I let my friend borrow my car yesterday and I regret it now.,oh yea why is that?

8057,I was talking to this girl_comma_ we had amazing chemistry and then she ghosted.,That's unfortunate. I have experienced similar things. I hope that she comes back around.
8059,I hope so to_comma_ because I don't see any reason why she would just stop talking to me or ignore my text_comma_ its weird.,Yeah_comma_ it is. But just realize that you are not the one acting weird.
8062,My dad had cancer and was bed ridden,Oh no_comma_ How long did he live? is he still alive?

8077,None of them! I stay far away!,"Oh. I thought you said ""like"" at first. I'm sorry. I like them! You should try watching more of them!"

Is it a new part of town?
8085,yeah. so i live in austin but moved up to the cedar park suburb.. about 15 minutes north of my old place. cedar park itself is not new but it has started growing because people can't afford the quickly rising prices in austin proper.,I get that. My city is going through that right now too. I moved to the suburbs and love it so far.
8087,Years ago when we moved into our home_comma_ we found a young kitten that had been abandoned.,Awww. Did you keep it?

8108,I wake up to a dead cell phone every single morning.,Oh that's the worst_comma_ I try to remember to charge but it's hard to remember every time.
8110,I charge it every night. My son steals it to watch youtube videos and falls asleep with it on.,So he's the culprit! He better start charging it or else it's revoked !
8113,I feel bad when i lie to my parents_comma_ even though I am an adult now,Yeah_comma_ same thing. They've done so much for me that I just feel bad doing things against them.
8115,Yeah_comma_ sometimes they are a bit pushy and commanding_comma_ but I still feel bad,That's family though. Unless they're straight up abusive_comma_ it's just something you have to deal with from time to time.

Im scared that she will think I am leaving her there and never coming back and I dont want her to feel that way.,Oh no_comma_ I am so sorry you have to leave your furbaby! Give her lots of extra snuggles and explain to her that you will be back and I am sure she will be delighted to see you upon your return!! Have you ever left her before?
8162,I know I just wish I knew if she could understand what I am saying to her. No I have never left this one before_comma_ shes 3 years old. I know it would be better if someone she knew could watch her but I couldn't find anyone.,I believe dogs can understand what you tell them_comma_ they understand if we say treat or ride after all lol. Maybe you could send a small blanket that smells like you or an old tshirt you have worn to bed. That may help her to feel more comfortable!
8164,I had to go to the car dealer to buy a new vehicle several years ago. I always get so nervous when I have to talk to the dealers.,I totally understand the anxiety. You never know if they are baiting you or actually giving you a good deal. Did you get a new car?

8368,Have you ever had a friend or loved one commit suicide.,Yes_comma_ I have. One that actually died and one that was miraculously saved. It was a dark and tough time. Did that happen to you recently?
8370,Yes_comma_ my brother in law/childhood friend took his own life. Its been very hard to comes to terms with.,I am soo soo very sorry. Its so hard to understand everything surrounding a suicide so its hard to be at peace about something that didn't have to happen. I pray you and your family will find closure and fight for awareness for people who are struggling with those feelings.
8372,I ate at a restaurant this morning and their bathroom was beyond gross. It was weird because the eating area was squeaky clean but their bathroom was the opposite.,That's disgusting. Makes me wonder what their kitchen looks like.
8374,I know right? I should have let them know to be honest.,I'd atleast leave a review about it.
8376,I wish I could of said goodbye before my friend died.,Aw man_comma_ that has to be rough. Were you guys really close?

8380,I am super proud of my parents for graduating college,That's great that they accomplished that and even better that you recognize their achievements.
8382,Yeah_comma_ they are truly an inspiration that anyone can go to college no matter the age,OK I didn't realize that they may have gone after you were born as opposed to before.
8384,I didn't get the job position I applied for and I really wanted it.,Sorry to hear that. Did you try to find similar job position on the job market?

8407,My cat pooped on the carpet today.,That stinks_comma_ did you clean it up?
8409,I did. I was so angry and cursing his 9 lives while tossing the nastiness away.,Will you get rid of the cat now?
8411,When I was about 5 I saw my dog get run over by a tractor. The vet said we should think about putting him down because it could have brain damage. I threw a fit in the clinic when he said that.,That's crazy_comma_ I can't believe your dog survived. Did you end up putting him down?
8413,No Dobie was around when I graduated High School. That was one tough doberman.,That's really impressive_comma_ I'm glad he was able to keep living and supporting you.
8415,I won $100 on a scratch off today. I was shocked. I never win.,Wow! How often do you play the lottery?

8419,I came across my wedding albums the other day and showed them to my kids.,Oh wow_comma_ I bet the emotions of that came back to you.
8421,Yes_comma_ it was so much fun to see the younger version of me and my husband_comma_ pre-kids. Very sentimental.,Yes_comma_ those memories are what make life so special.
8423,How was life when you were growing up?,It was pretty great but it was rough at times. You?
8425,Looking back it seems to have been very happy.,That's great to hear! Mine was mostly happy but of course there was some issues.
8428,I think the best day of my life was when i got a car for graduation. The day started with my mom giving me hints and such. I was wondering but thought it wasnt possible so I just refocused.,That's so sweet and fortunate that she was able to do that for you. I wish I could do that.
8430,It was so geb=nerous and unexpected. Im sure you can give in ways people will love.,You're right_comma_ and I do all of the time. What kind of car did you get?
8432,A saturn,I remember those cars! How long did it last you?
8434,I hope I'll get the funding for my experiments,Hey me too! What are you working on?
8436,Need time on the fMRI_comma_ and you?,No_comma_ I meant I hope you get the funding. Sounds interesting!!

8440,"nah i have kids he doesnt so he can spend crazy and i gotta be a ""parent""",Yep. That comes with being a parent.
8442,My new neighbors are terrible,That sucks... what are they doing?
8444,They've been here a week and they are so loud.,I know there probably isnt much you can do. :/ I hope it gets better...
8446,I am feeling nervous about leaving for my trip. I am supposed to go for three months.,That sounds exciting and a little scary. Where are you going?
8448,I am going all over western Europe. Its a little daunting to think about.,I took a trip to europe once. Once you get used to riding the rails and traveling around it's a blast.
8450,My daughter had an end of the year play at school and I was one happy dad,That's awesome! Did she have a good time doing the play?
8452,not really lol she was the cat and the fiddle. She doesnt like being the center of attention,I now the feeling_comma_ I always had stage fright as a kid. Hopefully it wasn't too tough for her.
8454,I was in the mood to try some baking the other day_comma_ and I tried something really challenging. It actually turned out pretty well.,That's good_comma_ new experiences can lead to new likes and dislikes. The important thing is that you keep an open mind.
8456,That's true. It helps when the results taste good_comma_ too!,Exactly_comma_ hopefully you found a new hobby.
8458,As a teenager my family moved around a lot. I never looked forward to entering a new school.,That sucks_comma_ I imagine nothing ever became familiar to you.
8460,You just get settled in and then you go again.,Yeah_comma_ a bit like how my employment goes.
8462,I am happy I didn't work in over a year it was hard to get a job but I finally got one_comma_ thanks to a friend,congratulations on getting your job we should go celebrate !
8464,Oh yes we should let's go have some cake and ice cream.,as long as the cake is funfetti i am more than there
8466,I once had a party when I was a teenager. My parents were out of town.,Haha everyone has to do that once. Can you tell me a great story about the party?
8468,Sure can! Of course you cant have a party as a teen without alcohol_comma_ so needless to say we were all drunk. We attempted to play darts. Since we were all drunk we missed the board leaving wholes all over the wall. THe house was trashed when my parents returned. Years later I feel bad about it still.,Hahaha thats funny. I hope you guys are still on good terms. To be honest little holes sounds like an easy fix.
8470,I was let down when my friends didn't come to my birthday party.,That is not cool of them_comma_ did they have a good reason?
8472,They never told me why.,well anyways it is really bad on their part that they did that
8474,I got all it takes to pass my exams tomorrow,Oh that sounds good! I'm sure you studied lots?
8476,Yes I am fully prepared,That is excellent news. You must be very proud.
8478,It was quite an experience flying for the first time.,I can just imagine_comma_ it must have been exciting for you.
8480,I was kind of scared but I put my trust in to the pilot to get me safely to Montreal for a festival.,That is so nice_comma_ the good thing is you arrived safely.
8482,Having a kid can be one of the most happy moments in a person's life. I cannot express how much happiness my daughter has brought to us since she was born.,thats amazing i cant wait to have my own one day
8484,It can be hard but it's one of the best experiences that I have had in life.,i bet so!
8486,5,Five is a great number_comma_ but six is even better. It's my favorite number_comma_ don't know why either!
8488,oops! sorry about that. I want to tell you that I have been taking guitar lessons for almost a year now and will be playing in my first recital. I've got my song down perfectly so I know I'll do great.,No worries! That's so awesome. Are you taking lessons from a musician in a class_comma_ one on one_comma_ or online?
8491,On my first date with my wife we got so drunk that I ended up wetting the bed!,oh wow! did she notice?
8493,She did! She didn't tell me though for years!,how did you feel when you eventually found out that she know?
8495,Absolutely silly! I never knew that was possible!,You must have been really drunk!
8497,one time I was on a boat and got stranded at see.,Oh man_comma_ did you have plenty of food and water?
8499,Nope_comma_ we didn't walk with any_comma_ wasn't expecting.,Dang well its a good thing that you made it out okay!
8502,I feel so at peace_comma_ and in a good mood today but very stable and relaxed. Yano?,Yeah I love that feeling_comma_ you need to cherish it!
8504,I am really I am taking it for as long as I can because it doesnt happen often. lol,That's good_comma_ try to figure out what caused it!
8506,I take full care of my grandmother!,I live and take care of my grandmother too!
8508,What things we have in common!,Yea_comma_ I feel that it is worth every second of it! They are the reasons we exist
8510,I just saw the most gross and disturbing thing running down the street. It was a backed old man.,a backed old man?
8512,No a naked old man. It was so gross.,Hahaha yeah_comma_ that kinda sucks
8514,My son's second birthday is coming up and it has been thinking of when he was born.,Aw he's still a little guy.
8516,I know_comma_ times just goes by so fast!,Cherish the moment while you can!
8518,as I walk through my house_comma_ the rooms are empty_comma_ There is no one there for me,I'm so sorry you feel that way. Maybe you should talk to someone you trust. A family member or a friend.
8520,that is the problem there is no one I can talk to or share with,I'm sorry. You could seek out a professional to talk to. Or you could just try meeting some new people.
8522,My brother recently told me that once_comma_ when we were kids_comma_ he spit in my orange juice and let me drink it.,lol that's terrible. Did he do stuff like that a lot back then?
8524,He kept that a secret for like 15 years so who knows what I'll find out next lol,You should prank him to get him back.
8526,So last night a cop pulled me over.,Oh man. What happened?
8528,He said I was speeding but I was really nervous.,Did you end up getting a ticket?
8531,My husband and I divorced_comma_ he has the kids this week for summer break. It's me_comma_ myself_comma_ and I in this apartment and it's eerily quiet.,Now you have a lot of privacy and can do things that you want!
8533,Yeah but I still miss my kids!,aw when will they be back?
8535,I'm so glad the kids went back to school today!,You must be relieved! You excited for free time?
8537,"Yes! I can go back to having ice cream for breakfast! I can watch Law and Order all I want to without the_comma_ ""Mom_comma_ you always watch this!"" comment!",That sounds seriously like a dream. I cannot wait until mine are old enough to start school.
8539,How old are they?,4 and 1. I have a bit to go haha.
8542,I saw someone throw some trash from a moving car yesterday. I was so angry.,That is infuriating. I dont see how some people are so unaware.
8544,I know_comma_ right? I wish I got their license plate. I would've reported them.,I feel you. Some people just suck.
8546,My wife is so made that I ate the piece of cake she was saving,lol i bet it was good
8548,It was but she would have prefered to find that out herself,sometimes it tastes better when it naughty
8550,I am all alone as well. Everyone is gone for their summer vacations.,That sucks. It's the same for me_comma_ only it's because we recently moved and I don't know anyone outside of work yet.
8552,Wife and kids went to see family and my friends went hunting without me.,Ouch. Were you too busy to go with them?
8554,I met this girl at a party one time and I totally thought she was into me_comma_ though I had no reason to really think so.,Oh really? Why is that? Seems like you were aware of it
8556,She was a little touchy feely but I think it was because she was a little tipsy. I asked her out though and she said yes and then we dated for a bit_comma_ so I guess my hunch turned out well.,Nice_comma_ good for you my dude. Hard to get girls these days.
8558,I'm feeling a little down since my wife will be gone for the weekend.,That's unfortunate. What are you going to do to keep yourself busy all weekend?
8560,I don't really have anything to do! I will be all alone here_comma_ so I probably will sleep in.,Sleeping in should be a positive thing! Take this as your time for yourself and relax.
8562,I am playing an official gig with a band I'm in and I can't wait. I know we'll be amazing.,Wow congrats! What type of music do you play?
8564,Thanks! Its good to actually get some money out of it. We play folk music with a rock twist. Its great music.,Nice_comma_ I really like folk music. I hope you guys put off a great show.
8566,Super sad today. It's the weekend pretty much and I have a hard time with loneliness on the weekends especially.,I am sorry. Maybe not focus as friday-sunday as the weekend_comma_ but as any other day. And do things you would normally do on other days.
8568,That is hard as there is not the typical work which keeps me busy on the weekdays.,That is a tough one. What do you normally do other then work on those days?
8570,Look for work_comma_ work on business and try not to let it get to me.,Is there anything else you do besides work? A hobby you enjoy_comma_ video games_comma_ music_comma_ working out?
8572,I workout daily. I try to keep busy but the loneliness eats at me right now. I just had to kick my partner out to go get help..I miss him..but I don't miss the bad parts..but it's still hard to be alone and do everything alone_comma_ you know? I am not at a music place yet. I am healing as well. Healing is NOT easy,Healing is never easy. It always has the negatives. Any sort of healing always starts with pain_comma_ a open wound_comma_ and itchy scabs_comma_ and the left over scar. I wish I could talk to you daily and help you get through it. I know its hard to go and do things alone. I recently discovered a text number that allows you to talk to someone when you are feeling down. it is 741741. I have used it just recently myself. It does work and is better then nothing.
8574,I was scared when they said a big storm was coming!,Oh man! I hate big storms too. Was it as bad as a hurricane?
8576,nah it was a windstorm. it ended up being fine,Well that's good. Did you lose any shingles from your roof?
8578,My cat tore apart my favorite book this morning,Oh no that sucks! What book?
8580,It a copy of the shining.,Ah I've never read it before_comma_ I was hoping it would have been one I'm familiar with.
8582,It's back to school time. I am a teacher and I spent time getting my classroom ready today.,That's got to be exciting! [And as a parent_comma_ I salute you!] What grade do you teach?
8584,I teach high school cooking! It's a lot of fun!,Oh_comma_ wow! That does sound fun! Just for the idea of eating in class every once in a while!
8586,Yeah_comma_ we eat almost everything we make. It's a great practical class.,What sorts of things do the kids learn how to make?
8588,We do everything from baking to pasta_comma_ starches_comma_ meat and poultry...we run a little mock restaurant for other teachers.,I wish they had that when I was in school in 199*coughcough* :)
8590,I got a free gift card from work!,I bet that was a nice surprise. Why did you get it?
8592,It was random_comma_ so i am not sure.,You are lucky then. Always good to receive things you arent expecting.
8594,I got all my gear squared away for a hunting trip next weekend.,What do you hunt?
8596,Lots of things. I love hunting and fishing and outdoor stuff in general but_comma_ dove season opens next weekend.,I didnt even know there was a dove season. I actually never even went camping before
8598,There is_comma_ they are a migratory bird and they're prized for their difficulty. You should try it some time. As long as your ok without creature comforts camping and hiking is awesome.,I want to some day.
8601,So my 1 year review at work is coming up and I feel its going to be good since I wokred so hard.,Hard work pays off in the long-run. If your work is truly authentic in its nature_comma_ it is definitely going to be recognized and appreciated
8603,I agree. I think my raise will be good as well as the promotion I asked for.,Be careful while negotiating your pay raise. Some managers may find it too intrusive and that may leave bad impression on them
8606,I don't like it when mosquitoes attack me while I'm having a good time at the beach,I agree! How annoying that is!
8608,I just want to tan and relax and they get in my face and sting my arms and legs_comma_ infuriating,I was of been furious as well. How could they ruin a nice day!!
8610,"I was very angry_comma_ my boss embarrassed me for nothing"".",what'd he do?
8612,It was transfer of aggression_comma_ someone annoyed him but he later apologized,well maybe you should find another job
8614,I was so afraid of going in my barn because I got stung by a wasp last year in my neck in the barn.,Ouch_comma_ I would try and wear something on your neck next time you go in there.
8616,Next time I will get stung somewhere besides my neck,Hmm_comma_ wear something thick and long. Maybe hockey pads!
8619,I was about to go to bed when my mother in law called with the shocking news that my sister in law was pregnant.,Why is it so shocking?
8621,Because I never expected her to get pregnant so young.,Well she is married right? some people say sister in law before its official
8623,I am so excited for all the good games coming out this year!,What's coming out?
8625,Super Smash Bros_comma_ Pokemon_comma_ and Mario Party!,There's way too many Pokemon these days
8627,I am trying a new diet and it not as hard as ones I have tried before.,What does this diet consist of?
8629,No bread_comma_ no soda_comma_ salads and wraps_comma_ and lots of water. I like all of those things so I'm fine with it,Salad and wraps are delicious_comma_ so is water. I need to try this diet!
8632,I am leaving in two days for a three month vacation. I have everything already packed and planned out.,Where are you going
8634,I am going all over south east Asia. I have all my flights booked. All I have to do is show up.,That sounds so fun
8636,I once woke up from sleeping to feel paralyzed_comma_ like someone was standing on my chest.,oh ive heard of that before.. scary stuff
8638,I started to see dark figuers and people fly toward me_comma_ I tried to yell. then I just blinked and everything was normal and I was awake.,has it happened more than once?
8640,If one of my customers has an issue I always find them an answer.,That's really kind of you. What good customer service!
8642,That is how you keep clients happy! Best part is it makes you feel good when you go home at night.,You deserve a raise for that mentality
8644,I was helping my girlfriend pack up her sons toys and he had a lite-brite. I used to have a lite-brite and loved playing with it when I was younger. It brought back some good memories.,I bought a lite brite from goodwill about a year ago. It was one of the remakes from recent years but we had fun with it.
8646,His is a new version too...those toys that were older were sooo much better but at least kids today can have an idea of how awesome they were back then!,Nope_comma_ they only know how to touch screens.
8648,Awhile back I was taking a relative to get a heart cath. The surgeon sent for me to enter the operating room.,Is your relative okay now?
8650,oh yes_comma_ thank you for asking. other family members just got a call and told them everything went ok. Kind of scary when I was sent for.,It must've have been. Glad they are okay now.
8652,i loved taking care of my sisters pet,Neat! What kind of pet does your sister have?
8654,a bearded dragon,That is so cool! What do you feed it?
8656,My wife went on a trip for a week to see her family but I had to work so I had to stay home alone.,I have never been on a trip before.
8658,I wish I could have went on this one but I couldn't. It ended up bein a long week by myself.,I have long weeks every single day.
8660,I remember the days when gas was a dollar a gallon.,I think I'm too young for that but man wouldn't that be nice today?
8662,Those were the good old days_comma_ young one.,I'm sure they were_comma_ I can barely afford to survive.
8664,A while back_comma_ my older sister stole my younger brother's iPod touch to sell.,That sucks. Did she make a lot of money off of it?
8666,No idea. All I know is that I was furious_comma_ especially seeing as my brother is the sweetest most innocent kid ever.,I would've been very angry too. I hope the money went towards something useful.
8668,I am really worried that I will miss my flight tomorrow.,I always worry about that too. Is it early in the morning?
8670,Yes and there is an expected rain storm.,Will you be able to leave a little bit earlier to allow time for any traffic delays?
8672,My cat died the other day.,I am sorry_comma_ that is always sad
8674,She was 24 years old.,Oh wow_comma_ it had a good life I am sure
8676,i am a failure,what makes you think so? i'm pretty sure you aren't.
8678,I wan't to help my fiance_comma_ she is going through so much_comma_ my job isn't paying me much and i've been working as hard as i can and i still can't do much_comma_ i wan't her to come here already because she is the only thing that keeps me sane,that doesn't make you a failure! you are doing more than enough and i'm pretty sure she appreciate every single thing you're doing for her.
8681,i had a huge test today_comma_but i was ready!,Sounds like you prepared well_comma_ congratulations! What do you think you got?
8683,grades will be posted tonight but i feel very good about it,That's always a good sign. When you feel good about it_comma_ you did well.
8685,I was really hurt when my boyfriend moved away.,Oh my goodness! Why did he move away?
8687,He always wanted to move out of state and I am unable to,Are you all still together? Long distance can be hard but honestly absence makes you love them even more!
8689,Last week_comma_ my car glass was broken by someone,What!? Did they steal anything?
8691,No. There was nothing to steal. Now_comma_ I need to pay to fix it. I am already having some financial issues.,That's no good. Those windows are not cheep either. Hopefully it wont cost too much.
8693,So ever single day my boss is late to work. 20 minutes or more. Today I was 1 minute late_comma_ first time in 2 years and I got a wrote up.,Wow. That's pretty hypocritical.
8695,Yea_comma_ I even called and let them know the highway was closed down and I was going to be late. I even text her photo of the traffic accident once I got up to it.,I think she's just trying to cause a problem.
8697,I have to give a speech on Thursday.,Are you prepared?
8699,Yes. But mentally I am never ready to give a speech if im being honest.,I relate_comma_ what is the speech on?
8702,I never feel more at peace than laying at my bed in the morning.,Sometimes I feel the same as you ... but I get up and move on
8704,It's not bad to lay around all day if you want.,That's right ... I wish I could do that ... disconnect
8706,I spent 2 hours helping my daughter with her homework. I found out today she never turned it in.,Did she forget it at home or did she just not bother turning it in?
8708,She just didn't bother. She won't even get credit for turning it in late. What a waste of time.,Be happy that you were able to spend some time with her and sharing personal time with her by helping her with her homework. Not many parents do that for their children
8711,i started off planting season with a few small seedlings and some plants from seed. i was anticipating the growth of my plants,Did the plants grow up to be big and strong?
8713,some grew very big others didn't do so well,That's good_comma_ are you going to try again?
8716,It always feels really good to think about great_comma_ happy times.,It does_comma_ any recent event that made you feel like that?
8718,Not so much recent but going back home and visiting my home town.,Oh_comma_ I am happy for you
8720,Reflecting back on my youth_comma_ I remember all the times I'd steal candy bars from the convenience store on the way home from school,haha we all did crazy things when we were young! did you ever get caught?
8722,No. I'd stop in with a group of people walking home_comma_ and slyly take my pick while others were legitimately buying.,good plan. Wait until the shopkeeper was busy with someone else.
8724,I ordered a birthday cake from the local bakery for my husband.,What kind of cake was it
8726,It was a chocolate cake. It was the best decorated cake I have ever seen.,That sounds so good
8728,my kids made it back from summer break,That is so nice to hear! You have a full house again! Did they have a good time?
8730,yes they had a good time and the house is back to being crazy.. i love it,Oh yeah! I hear you! A house full of kids is always crazy. Haha
8733,People around my workplace are always leaving litter all around the office and it really makes me mad.,That sounds so frustrating! I can't stand messy people.
8735,Same here. It's like they don't care about anyone else but themselves.,Sounds like it! Are you in a management position or something where you can say something to them?
8738,I hate I keep receiving double bills every month from Comcast.,omg i would be upset too... how many times have you called them to fix it?
8740,Every month they shut off my service because I didn't pay the second bill. Then I have to go all over this month after month of them fixing their errors.,Sounds like a nightmare! total.
8742,I'm glad the weekend is here.,So am I! Do you have plans?
8744,Going swimming Sunday_comma_ probably relaxing on Saturday.,That sounds good. I hope you get re-energized.
8746,Hello_comma_ last week I walked into a breakroom and I saw a big pizza laying there for anyone to grab up_comma_ however I chose not to take a slice and remain faithful to my diet.,Oh man_comma_ good for you! I would have caved for sure. Pizza is my life
8748,Mine too_comma_ but you know_comma_ you start with one and the next thing you know_comma_ half the pizza is gone. Its better to keep the eye on the prize,So true. I always eat it all. I really can't control myself so better not to even start. Good on you
8751,I think that in the past i have spent time caring about things that aren't important.,What kind of thing? You could always change that in the future.
8753,Money mostly. I just wish i could have enough of it to be set for life.,Of course_comma_ but that is certainly not the most important thing in life_comma_ I hope you realize now.

9182,We think he might have some sort of mental illness. He doesn't really want to listen to reason. I'm a single mother_comma_ can't exactly physically intervene in this situation with the best of results. Don't have any family I can call to have them come around either. Can't exactly have the police on-call for something that hasn't happened yet. Don't know what t do!,That sounds terrible. I hate to hear single mothers dealing with extra problems like these. If anything I would advise your son to be careful and defend himself.
9184,So I have a private office at work. Someone broke in the morning and stole $20 off my desk.,Why would you have twenty dollars on the desk
9186,For the vending machine at lunch. I lock my wallet up took 20 out put on my desk. Had to run to the bathroom. Came back and it was gone. I share my office with no one.,OH. Thats terrible.
9188,I took an important test last week.,I hope you did well. Was it difficult?
9190,Yes_comma_ but I am sure I did good.,What was the test over?

9202,I'm not sure but the report said there were over 20 bugs found. Can you imagine how gross the kitchen must be?,Yes. I wouldn't go back.
9204,feel so bad_comma_ I forgot again to fill the gas tank up in the car after I used it all. My friend is going to kill me!,Oh no.. and no one really likes pumping gas.
9206,I just seem to forget until I get home. Oh well I will just have to give her some money again instead. Oh she is going to be angry.,You could grab it when shes done with it and fill it up real quick for her!
9209,It was a tough day at work,Awe_comma_ I am sorry. What made it tough?
9211,My boss kept criticizing my work. He kept bugging on me to an unbearable point.,I hate when bosses are like that. Is he normally like that? If so_comma_ I would sit him down and talk to him and tell him how his actions are affecting you

9223,It is my favorite I really like Masterchef Junior though. Those kids are inspiring.,Yeah_comma_ Gordon can be pretty supportive too_comma_ and soft spoken_comma_ which is surprising.
9225,I know. He is rarely like that in Hell's Kitchen.,Yeah_comma_ and mostly near the end. When its the first few rounds I think he feels they haven't earned any sort of sympathy or support_comma_ since things are just starting out.
9227,I get so mad when I watch shows about animal shelters and see how many people abuse animals.,I own an animal shelter here in my home town.
9229,It must be so hard to deal with emotionally at times. Just watching a show makes me want to lash out.,I try to pass that onto my top doctors to take care of the dogs.
9231,Recently_comma_ I've been working on a presentation for a client at work,Interesting. What is your presentation about?
9233,It's a pitch about an app our company is developing_comma_ like a chatbot,That's so cool! Is it like a best friend for someone who may be lonely?

9240,Lady backed into my car the other day and proceeds to tell me she doesn't have insurance.,Oh my. That would really tick me off. In my state they will lose their license for that.
9242,I had just bought the car two days before the accident.,Well I hope your insurance company sues them. They should really be more responsible.
9244,So a few weeks ago a tire on my car blew while i was driving it on the highway.,Oh no! What happened? Did you get into an accident?
9246,Thankfully no_comma_ I was able to control it until I got it off the road to the side.,That has happened to me before too. The car started swaying side to side from the rear tires but I just took my foot off the gas and let the car do what it wanted until I was able to stop. So scary! I know how you feel.
9248,I'm a teacher. and school starts back up in just 2 weeks.,COunting down the days_comma_ eh? How was your summer?
9250,I had a great summer. I'm feeling really good about this coming year. Teaching the same grade for the third time.,That's awesome that you get that continuity. More teachers would succeed if that was available to them. Good for you!
9252,I am worried about having enough money for rent.,oh you mean not having enough to pay your rent?
9254,Yeah I don't have many days left to get $100.,I am sure there is a special friend that can help you with that amount and when you have you can repay them back
9256,I shot a roll on 35mm film. I was very excited to see the results.,That sounds like fun. What were you taking pictures of? I didn't know film existed anymore lol

9261,I was talking to a British friend of mine and trying to explain why our president feels compelled to tweet,I am sure that was an interesting conversation. What did your friend think?
9263,They think someone needs to take his phone away,Lol I think that even the people who like him would agree with that
9265,I'm so lonely. I mean... i have no friends_comma_ no husband_comma_ no kids. i wish i had at least somebody in my life,Do you have any hobbies that may help you to meet people?
9267,not really. i love playing video games and watch tv. i'm socially awkward,Same here. Try to take advantage of your gaming and be more outgoing during gametime.
9269,The kids next door keep riding my bikes through my yard. I asked them to stop but they just laughed at me.,Where are their parents?
9271,Who knows_comma_ they're never watching them. I tried to be nice but they're killing all my flowers_comma_,Call the police. I would.
9273,Last time I got really drunk_comma_ I told my girlfriend that I thought her best friend was really attractive.,Oh no! I bet she was mad as heck

9288,I did! The anxiety and waiting paid off that Christmas morning. Reflecting back_comma_ the shape of the present should've gave away the gift_comma_ but I couldn't take any chances assuming.,Thats wonderful. Oddly shaped Christmas presents usually make you want to open them EARLY just to get a peak :)
9290,I found my bike infront of a store before i even knew it got stolen,Did you at least get it back?

I really admire anyone in that career_comma_ its not just a job but a vocation.,You've really got to be committed to go into work like that. It's not for everybody_comma_ I agree.
10079,Got everything packed and ready for my camping trip this weekend. Should be a great time.,Hey that's awesome! Where ya going?
10081,Out in the woods near a friend's place_comma_ haven't been in a long time!,Yeah I haven't either. I bet it's gonna be awesome. Bring plenty of beer :D

10097,Yeah_comma_ I'm proud of her. But sometimes I feel like she's enabling him and acts as a crutch for him. Don't know if it's my business to say so_comma_ though,Enabling is pretty bad. People don't learn if someone is always saving them from every thing.

10116,It's a family heirloom.,Even better. Are you doing all the work yourself or do you have a restoration person helping you?
10118,I've done it all myself. It takes a long time_comma_ but that's part of the fun.,That's true. You must be a very good mechanic to do all that - I know the amount of work it takes!
10120,My food order today did not turn out as well as I had hoped.,Sorry to hear! What all did you order? And what was wrong with it?
10122,Everything was cold. We had burgers and fries. You can't eat cold fries.,Cold fries are the *worst* b/c the potatoes are just gross at that point. Did you get your money back_comma_ at least?

10143,You definitely got a point there. I know we all have our bad days but that does not give you a right to take it out on someone that is trying to patronize your business. I have my favorite companies I buy from just to make sure that I leave away with a happy experience every time. What about you?,Same here_comma_ CS is just as important as the products we buy.

10246,i thought about it but the maintainance cost is at least 4k a year for that size,I mean I would never be able to afford that but if they can then it is nothing for them to do the routine care.
10248,Ever have those days when everything just goes wrong?,Yes_comma_ many. Would you like to tell me about it?
10250,Well if you're curious_comma_ I was on my way to work when my car broke down and I ended up missing a very important meeting about my promotion. I was devastated.,Surely you were able to explain that this was out of your control.
10252,A few months ago I broke my wrist. I had so much family support_comma_ it made me very happy.,It's always nice to have people around you that care about you. They make hard times much easier.
